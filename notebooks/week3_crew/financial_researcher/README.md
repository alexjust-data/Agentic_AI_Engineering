### Defining our agents

This block defines the researcher agent. Its role is to act as a Senior Financial Researcher for the given company. The agent’s goal is to research the company, find news, and assess its potential. The backstory describes the agent as someone skilled at identifying and presenting the most relevant information. The model assigned here is OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.

```yml
researcher:
  role: >
    Senior Financial Researcher for {company}
  goal: >
    Research the company, news and potential for {company}
  backstory: >
    You're a seasoned financial researcher with a talent for finding
    the most relevant information about {company}.
    Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini
  ```

This block defines the analyst agent. Its job is to analyze the target company and write a comprehensive report. The backstory highlights the analyst’s meticulous approach and skill in turning research into valuable, clear insights. This agent also uses GPT-4o-mini.

```yml
analyst:
  role: >
    Market Analyst and Report writer focused on {company}
  goal: >
    Analyze company {company} and create a comprehensive, well-structured report
    that presents insights in a clear and engaging way
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous, skilled analyst with a background in financial analysis
    and company research. You have a talent for identifying patterns and extracting
    meaningful insights from research data, then communicating
    those insights through well crafted reports.
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

### Tasks Configuration

The research task, assigned to the researcher, details what to investigate about the company (current status, history, challenges, opportunities, news, outlook). Findings should be well organized into clear sections.


```yml
# src/research_crew/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct thorough research on company {company}. Focus on:
    1. Current company status and health
    2. Historical company performance
    3. Major challenges and opportunities
    4. Recent news and events
    5. Future outlook and potential developments

    Make sure to organize your findings in a structured format with clear sections.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive research document with well-organized sections covering
    all the requested aspects of {company}. Include specific facts, figures,
    and examples where relevant.
  agent: researcher
```

The analysis task, assigned to the analyst, requires a report based on the research findings, including an executive summary, key information, insights, and a market outlook. The report must be professional and easy to read.
Importantly, the analysis task takes the research_task as its context, ensuring output continuity, and the result is saved to output/report.md.

```yml
analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the research findings and create a comprehensive report on {company}.
    Your report should:
    1. Begin with an executive summary
    2. Include all key information from the research
    3. Provide insightful analysis of trends and patterns
    4. Offer a market outlook for company, noting that this should not be used for trading decisions
    5. Be formatted in a professional, easy-to-read style with clear headings
  expected_output: >
    A polished, professional report on {company} that presents the research
    findings with added analysis and insights. The report should be well-structured
    with an executive summary, main sections, and conclusion.
  agent: analyst
  context:
    - research_task
  output_file: output/report.md
```

### Research `Crew.py` Implementation

This file defines the `ResearchCrew class`, which wires up our agents and tasks.
* There are two agents: researcher and analyst.
* Two tasks: research_task and analysis_task.
* The crew runs the agents and tasks in a sequential process, meaning each task waits for the previous to finish, ensuring correct order and context passing.

```py
# src/financial_researcher/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class ResearchCrew():
    """Research crew for comprehensive topic analysis and reporting"""

    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
            verbose=True,
            tools=[SerperDevTool()]
        )

    @agent
    def analyst(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['analyst'],
            verbose=True
        )

    @task
    def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['research_task']
        )

    @task
    def analysis_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['analysis_task'],
            output_file='output/report.md'
        )

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the research crew"""
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

## `main.py` Script to Run the Crew
* It ensures the output directory exists.
* Sets the company to be researched.
* Instantiates the ResearchCrew and kicks it off with the company input.
* Prints the result and confirms where the report was saved.


```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/financial_researcher/main.py
import os
from financial_researcher.crew import ResearchCrew

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('output', exist_ok=True)

def run():
    """
    Run the research crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'company': 'Apple'
    }

    # Create and run the crew
    result = ResearchCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)

    # Print the result
    print("\n\n=== FINAL REPORT ===\n\n")
    print(result.raw)

    print("\n\nReport has been saved to output/report.md")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

To run the workflow, open a terminal in the project folder and execute the command to start the process (e.g., crewai run). Inputs like the company name will be assigned automatically, and you’ll see the research agent take on the assigned task. Some models may be slower but provide more detailed research.

The process is set to sequential, and all verbose output is enabled for transparency.

**Why context matters and the problem with knowledge cutoffs**

The key point is that the second agent, which generated the summary of the research report on Tesla, could do so effectively because it received the output from the first agent as its context. This is how it was able to produce a relevant summary. However, if you look at the details, you will notice the information was current only up to October 2023, such as the mention of “Key Financial Metrics Q3 2023.” This is disappointing, since it's not recent data. The reason for this is that we relied on the research agent, which used DeepSeek, and DeepSeek was last trained in 2023. It cannot provide more up-to-date information.

**How to fix outdated research with tools**

To solve this problem, you can add a tool that enables real-time search. The plan is to return to `crew.py`, the module where the crew is defined, and add a new import from crew\.ai tools. Specifically, you want to use the SERPA.dev tool. This tool lets the agent perform Google lookups using your SERPA.dev API key, which must be added to your `.env` file.


**Assigning the search tool to the researcher agent**

The next step is to ensure only the researcher agent has access to the SERPA.dev tool. This is done by adding the tool to the researcher's `tools` list when you create the agent instance. The implementation is simple: instantiate the SERPA.dev tool and include it in the researcher’s configuration. Only the researcher should have access; the analyst does not need it.


**Running the process with the new tool**

Once this change is saved, you can switch the LLM model if you wish— for speed, you might select OpenAI GPT-4o Mini. Then, open a terminal, navigate to your financial researcher directory, and run the workflow with `crew.ai run`.


**Observing up-to-date results**

Now, when the workflow executes, the researcher agent will use the SERPA.dev tool to search Google for up-to-date information, such as “Tesla latest news today.” The process includes multiple searches and gathers recent information— for example, results from 2025 appear in the search, showing you are now getting the latest data.

The researcher completes the data collection, then hands off to the report writer agent (using, for example, Grok). The summary and final report now include the most current news about Tesla, including events from the last month or even last week. The final report is clear, accurate, and highly relevant.


**Key takeaways and advantages**

* The infrastructure is easy to build with Crew: just a few commands and clear YAML objectives for each agent and task.
* Assigning tools to agents (like SERPA.dev to the researcher) is straightforward.
* The costs are low or even free if you use the available credits.
* The system now produces high-quality, up-to-date reports with very little manual effort.
* The resulting reports are comparable to what a human would produce after 10–15 minutes of focused research and synthesis.

> With these improvements, your automated financial researcher can gather and report the latest information, not just rely on LLM training cutoffs. Crew makes it simple to connect tools, agents, and tasks, and enables experimentation with different models and tool assignments for better results.
