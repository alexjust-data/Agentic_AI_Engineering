This design includes:

- An `Account` class to manage user account actions.
- Methods to deposit and withdraw funds, buy and sell shares.
- Calculations for portfolio value and profit/loss.
- Reporting functions for holdings and transaction history.
- A mock `get_share_price` function for share pricing. 

The design ensures negative balances are prevented, shares purchased/sold respect the account's funds and holdings, and provides a basis for a self-contained unit that is ready for testing or simple UI extensions.
