## Crew AI

This marks a transition from the familiar **OpenAI Agents SDK** to the world of **Crew AI**. Although the shift may feel abrupt, it's part of an ongoing process of exploring different agent frameworks. Each one offers unique perspectives and tools, and each will be more or less suited depending on the project at hand.

You’re encouraged to:

* Note the similarities and differences between frameworks.
* Decide for yourself which tool best suits your needs.
* Learn something valuable from each one.


**What Is Crew AI?**

**Crew AI** refers to multiple things, depending on context. These include:

**1. Crew AI Enterprise**

Also called the **Crew AI Platform**, this is a commercial platform for:

* Deploying agents
* Monitoring agent behavior
* Managing workflows through various dashboards

You can visit it at: **crewai.com** (not **crew\.ai**)

**2. Crew AI UI Studio**

A **low-code/no-code** tool for:

* Building agent interactions visually
* Allowing end-users to create workflows without coding

**3. Crew AI Framework**

An **open-source** Python framework built for:

> “Orchestrating high-performing AI agents with ease and scale.”

This is the focus of the course: writing code and building agents from scratch using the open-source framework, not the commercial tools.


**Commercial Strategy of Crew AI**

Unlike OpenAI or Anthropic (which monetize via their LLMs), Crew AI:

* Needs a business model built around its tooling
* Offers the **free framework** as entry
* Monetizes through **hosting**, **deployment**, and **enterprise tools**

This is why the website includes heavy upselling — it aims to convert open-source users into paying enterprise customers.


**Two Modes in the Crew AI Framework**

Once inside the open-source framework, there are **two major approaches**:

**1. Crew AI Cruise**

* Teams of agents collaborating
* Roles are assigned to different agents
* Supports **autonomous**, **creative**, or **exploratory** solutions
* Suitable for agentic, unscripted workflows

“Crew” = A team of agents working together

**2. Crew AI Flows**

* Structured and linear workflows
* Tasks are broken into **deterministic steps**
* Includes decision points and expected outcomes
* Useful for **auditability**, **control**, or **predictable behavior**

This is likely a newer addition, possibly a response to concerns about the unpredictability of Cruise-style setups in production environments.


**When to Use Each Mode**

| Mode       | Best For                                                              |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cruise** | Autonomous problem-solving, creative collaboration, exploratory tasks |
| **Flows**  | Deterministic workflows, precision, audit trails                      |


## Core Concepts of Crew AI

**Agent**

An **agent** is the smallest autonomous unit in Crew AI. It is linked to an LLM and includes:

* **Role**: A description of what the agent does
* **Goal**: The purpose or objective of the agent
* **Backstory**: Context or background information for priming
* **Memory**: Optional storage for past interactions
* **Tools**: Optional tools the agent can use

Agents resemble those in OpenAI Agents SDK but are more prescriptive: instead of a single `instruction`, Crew AI uses multiple structured fields (role, goal, backstory).

**Task**

A **task** is a unit of work assigned to an agent. It includes:

* **Description**: What the task is
* **Expected Output**: The desired result
* **Agent**: The agent responsible for executing it

Tasks are a new construct, not present in OpenAI Agents SDK, and help separate logic from behavior.

**Crew**

A **crew** is a combination of:

* Multiple **agents**
* Multiple **tasks**

It defines how agents and tasks work together to solve a problem.

Crew can operate in two modes:

* **Sequential**: Tasks are executed in a defined order
* **Hierarchical**: A manager LLM dynamically assigns tasks to agents

---

**Comparison with OpenAI Agents SDK**

Crew AI is:

* **More opinionated**: Requires structured agent configuration
* **More prescriptive**: Enforces concepts like roles and backstories
* **Less transparent**: The system prompt is generated from multiple fields rather than a single `instruction`, which can make debugging more complex
* **Configurable**: Uses YAML to separate configuration from code

**Configuration via YAML**

Crew AI supports agent and task configuration via YAML files.
Advantages:

* **Separation of concerns**: Prompts and configuration are outside the main Python code
* **Easier to manage**: Especially for larger projects with many agents
* **Readable**: YAML is easy for humans to read and write

You can create agents by:

* Writing code: `Agent(...)`
* Referring to a YAML configuration: e.g. `"config.agent_config['researcher']"

**Python Structure: `crew.py`**

This is the main module where agents, tasks, and crews are defined.

**Decorators**

Crew AI uses decorators to structure the code:

| Decorator    | Purpose                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@crew_base` | Marks the main class managing the crew         |
| `@agent`     | Decorates a method that defines an agent       |
| `@task`      | Decorates a method that defines a task         |
| `@crew`      | Decorates the function that assembles the crew |

These decorators:

* Register agents and tasks automatically
* Allow referencing `self.agents`, `self.tasks` in the final crew assembly
* Specify mode (`sequential` or `hierarchical`) within the `@crew` function



## LightLLM and CrewAI Project Setup

CrewAI uses **LightLLM**, a minimal and ultra-flexible framework, to connect with any LLM. Unlike heavier frameworks like LangChain, LightLLM allows you to:

* Connect instantly to hosted or local LLMs
* Use almost any provider or model
* Configure access easily in code or `.env` files

**Example usage**

```python
llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
llm = LLM(model="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
llm = LLM(model="gemini/gemini-2-0-flash")
llm = LLM(model="groq/llama-3-70b-versatile")
llm = LLM(model="ollama/llama3.2", base_url="http://localhost:11434")
llm = LLM(
    model="openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1",
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY
)
```

* The model format: `"provider/model"`
* Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, OpenRouter, etc.
* Can also run local models (e.g., via Ollama)



## LightLLM and Model Flexibility in CrewAI

One of the key advantages of CrewAI is its lightweight and flexible way of interacting with LLMs. Under the hood, it uses a framework called LightLLM. LightLLM is a very minimalistic and straightforward tool to interface with actual LLM providers. The speaker likes LightLLM a lot because of its simplicity and lack of overhead, especially compared to frameworks like LangChain, which add a lot of structure.

LightLLM allows you to connect to any LLM easily. In CrewAI, you just create an LLM by passing a model name. The naming structure follows this pattern: provider name followed by a slash, then the model name. This makes it easy to switch between different providers and models.

Examples include GPT-4 from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, 3.5 and 3.7 versions, Gemini, Flash, Grok (with a “Q” or a “K”), and local models using Ollama. For local models, you can configure them by providing a base URL. You can also use OpenRouter, which acts as an abstraction layer over multiple LLMs. Configuring OpenRouter involves setting a base URL and an API key.

The idea behind all of this is to provide a simple and flexible system for connecting to any model you need. The speaker believes this gives CrewAI a clear advantage over OpenAI Agents SDK, which is more tightly coupled to a specific provider.


## Structure and Workflow of a CrewAI Project

The next major topic is how CrewAI handles projects. In earlier weeks of the course, everything was done inside Python notebooks (like in Cursor), or occasionally through basic Python modules. CrewAI, however, does not work that way. It requires working with actual Python code and comes with its own project and directory structure.

The CrewAI framework has already been installed using this command:

```bash
uv tool install crewai
```

That means when you clone the repo, the framework is already available.

To create a new Crew project, you use this command:

```bash
crewai create crew my_crew
```

You can name the project whatever you want. For example, “my\_crew” or “my\_project.”

Alternatively, if you want to work with flows instead of crews (i.e., fixed workflows rather than agent-based ones), you can use:

```bash
crewai create flow my_project
```

However, in the course, the focus is on crews, not flows.

Running the `crewai create crew` command generates a full directory structure. At the top level is the project directory, such as `my_crew`. Inside that is a subdirectory called `src`. Within `src`, there is another directory with the name of your project, such as `my_crew` again.


```bash

```

**Inside debate/:**

Contains a subfolder: `knowledge/`
* File: user_preference.yaml
* Contains user-specific background info.
* Used to pass context to the model (not used in this example).
```bash
(agents_env) ➜  week3_crew git:(main) cat debate/knowledge/user_preference.txt
User name is John Doe.
User is an AI Engineer.
User is interested in AI Agents.
User is based in San Francisco, California.
```

**source/ Folder**:

Path: `debate/source/debate/`

This nested structure exists because the project name is also **debate**.  

Subfolder: `config/` This folder contains two YAML files by default:
* `agents.yaml`, where you define agent configurations.
* `tasks.yaml`, where you define task configurations.
* Both with defeault examples.

Subfolder: `tools/`
* Empty or with placeholder code
* For adding custom tools later (not used in this example)

Python files:  
Also in the same directory are two important Python modules:
* `crew.py`, which is where you define your crew using decorators.
* `main.py`, which is the script that starts the execution of your crew.

```sh
mkdir other # ← optional dummy folder to make VS Code show tree view properly
```

#### Now we going to define our files

**`agents.yaml`** :

And this contains some default, some sort of scaffolding, some example agents that are called the Researcher and the Reporting Analyst are the two examples it's given and we're going to change these to being what we're looking to build, and of course **we're looking to build a little debate team**, and in fact we only need **two agents** for what we're looking to do. We want an agent that will be the debater. One agent is going to play both roles of being for and against the motion 

```yaml
debater:
  role: >
    A compelling debater
  goal: >
    Present a clear argument either in favor of or against the motion. The motion is: {motion}
```
So now we have a back story... you're an experienced debater with a knack for giving concise but convincing arguments. You can also specify what model to use... GPT-40 Mini... or OpenAI/GPT-40 Mini...

```yaml
  backstory: >
    You're an experienced debator with a knack for giving concise but convincing arguments.
    The motion is: {motion}
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini
```
> Note : the `{motion}` fields acts as a dynamic template that will in `main.py`

But now let’s define our judge... the role we will say is decide the winner of the debate.. 

```yaml
judge:
  role: >
    Decide the winner of the debate based on the arguments presented
  goal: >
    Given arguments for and against this motion: {motion}, decide which side is more convincing,
    based purely on the arguments presented.
```

You’re a fair judge with a reputation for weighing up arguments without factoring in your own views... You can just have GPT-40 Mini, or... anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest...

```yaml
  backstory: >
    You are a fair judge with a reputation for weighing up arguments without factoring in
    your own views, and making a decision based purely on the merits of the argument.
    The motion is: {motion}
  llm: anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest
```

**`tasks.yaml`**:

The first task is to propose the motion — that is, give a strong argument in favor of it.
This task is assigned to the debater agent. 

```yaml
propose:
  description: >
    You are proposing the motion: {motion}.
    Come up with a clear argument in favor of the motion.
    Be very convincing.
  expected_output: >
    Your clear argument in favor of the motion, in a concise manner.
  agent: debater
  output_file: output/propose.md
```

The second task is to oppose the motion — that is, produce a strong argument against it.
Again, the same debater agent is used, but now in oposición.

```yaml
oppose:
  description: >
    You are in opposition to the motion: {motion}.
    Come up with a clear argument against the motion.
    Be very convincing.
  expected_output: >
    Your clear argument against the motion, in a concise manner.
  agent: debater
  output_file: output/oppose.md
```
Finally, the judge reviews the arguments and makes a decision about which side is more convincing.

```yaml
decide:
  description: >
    Review the arguments presented by the debaters and decide which side is more convincing.
  expected_output: >
    Your decision on which side is more convincing, and why.
  agent: judge
  output_file: output/decide.md
```

final result:

```yaml
propose  →  debater  →  output/propose.md
oppose   →  debater  →  output/oppose.md
decide   →  judge    →  output/decide.md
```

**`crew.py`**:

So this is the default module crew.py and you can see it's got some stuff in here based on the standard scaffolding.
It has created a class and it's got this crew base decorator around it and this class is named the same as the name of our project: Debate. 

It brings in the agents config and the tasks config from the config folder. You can see how it refers directly to our configuration...

```py
@CrewBase
class Debate():
    """Debate crew"""

    agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'
    tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'

```
We don’t have an agent called researcher, we have debater. The @agent decorator tells CrewAI this method defines an agent.

```py
    @agent
    def debater(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['debater'],
            verbose=True
        )
    @agent
    def judge(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['judge'],
            verbose=True
        )
```
And now we’re going to define our tasks.
First propose, then oppose, and finally decide.

```py
    @task
    def propose(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['propose'],
        )

    @task
    def oppose(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['oppose'],
        )

    @task
    def decide(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['decide'],
        )
```

So those are our two agents and three tasks...
And now we define the Crew object that puts it all together.

```py
    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the Debate crew"""

        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,  # autogenerado por los métodos @agent
            tasks=self.tasks,    # autogenerado por los métodos @task
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

**`main.py`**

This main file is intended to run your crew locally, so refrain from adding unnecessary logic.

So inputs, when we’re running the crew, this is where we choose those template values that we put in our YAML file.

```py
inputs = {
    'motion': 'There needs to be strict laws to regulate LLMs',
}
```
We should now be ready to run our first crew just based on that.

```py
result = Debate().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
print(result.raw)
```
---

Internally, this runs:

```bash
uv run main.py

│  Furthermore, LLMs pose privacy concerns, as they can potentially generate personal or sensitive         │
│  information without consent. Regulations can help define the boundaries of acceptable use, thus         │
│  protecting individuals’ rights and privacy.                                                             │

│  Finally, the rapid advancement of LLMs outpaces our understanding of their full implications. Clear,    │
│  enforceable laws are necessary to adapt to evolving technology while ensuring safety and ethical use.   │
│  In conclusion, strict laws to regulate LLMs are essential to safeguard truth, protect the vulnerable,   │

│  While the concerns surrounding large language models (LLMs) are valid, imposing strict laws to          │
│  regulate them can stifle innovation, impede progress, and limit their potential benefits for society.   │
│  Here are several compelling arguments against the motion:                                               │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Firstly, overregulation can hinder technological advancement. The rapid development of LLMs has led to  │
│  groundbreaking applications across various fields, including healthcare, education, and content         │
│  creation. Imposing strict laws may create barriers to innovation, preventing beneficial advancements    │
│  that could significantly improve lives and societal functions.                                          │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Secondly, the implementation of strict laws may disproportionately affect smaller companies and         │
│  startups that lack the resources to comply with extensive regulatory frameworks. This could further     │
│  entrench the dominance of larger corporations, limiting diversity and competition in the field. A more  │
│  nuanced approach that encourages responsible development while still permitting creativity and growth   │
│  is necessary.                                                                                           │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Additionally, while concerns about misinformation and bias are important, it is essential to recognize  │
│  that humans are ultimately responsible for the use of these technologies. Rather than creating rigid    │
│  laws, we should focus on developing guidelines that promote ethical use and enhance digital literacy    │
│  among users. Empowering individuals with knowledge and skills will lead to more responsible engagement  │
│  with LLMs than strict regulations ever could.                                                           │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Moreover, the technology itself is evolving rapidly. Regulations that may seem appropriate today can    │
│  quickly become outdated as the landscape changes. A flexible regulatory framework that adapts to        │
│  technological advancements is far more pragmatic than strict laws that may struggle to keep pace.       │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Lastly, collaboration between developers, ethicists, and the community can lead to better outcomes      │
│  than stringent legislation. By fostering open dialogue and shared best practices, we can mitigate       │
│  risks while still allowing for the exploration of new ideas and methodologies.                          │
│                                                                                                          │
│  In conclusion, while addressing the challenges posed by LLMs is necessary, strict laws are not the      │
│  solution. We should prioritize fostering innovation, encouraging responsible use, and adapting our      │
│  approach to regulation in line with the evolving nature of technology. An overbearing legal framework   │
│  risks stifling the significant benefits that LLMs have to offer, ultimately hindering progress and      │
│  societal advancement.                                                                                   │

│  After thoroughly evaluating the arguments presented for and against the motion that strict laws need    │
│  to be established to regulate large language models (LLMs), the case for imposing such laws is          │
│  ultimately more convincing.                                                                             │
│                                                                                                          │
│  The arguments in favor highlight several critical points that underscore the necessity of regulation.   │
│  First and foremost, the proliferation of misleading and false information generated by LLMs carries     │
│  significant risks—not only to individual users but broadly to societal trust and cohesion. Without      │
│  regulation, these technologies could exacerbate misinformation and create division among communities,   │
│  potentially influencing public opinion in detrimental ways.                                             │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Moreover, the issue of bias in LLMs cannot be understated. The recognition that these models can        │
│  perpetuate existing biases present in training data raises ethical concerns that impact marginalized    │
│  populations. Establishing strict laws would foster accountability in the development and deployment of  │
│  LLM technology, ensuring a more ethical approach that protects vulnerable groups.                       │
│                                                                                                          │

agents_env➜  debate git:(main) ✗
```

This setup creates a complete UV (micro) project. So when you run `crewai create crew`, it automatically generates UV project configuration files. These UV projects will be nested within the larger UV project that contains the entire course. This structure will become more intuitive once you see it in practice.


```bash
(agents_env) ➜  my_agents git:(main) tree notebooks/week3_crew/debate/output
notebooks/week3_crew/debate/output
├── decide.md
├── oppose.md
└── propose.md
```

**Final Note Before Practice**

The course is now ready to start using CrewAI hands-on. Everything is set up with UV, CrewAI is installed, and the directory structure has been generated. The next step is to go ahead and actually try it out by building your own crew.

In this first project using **CrewAI**, we successfully completed a full execution cycle of a crew of agents designed to simulate an automated debate using LLMs.

* **YAML configuration**: We defined the agents (`debater` and `judge`) and tasks (`propose`, `oppose`, `decide`) in the `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files.

* **crew\.py module**: We created the main crew class using the `@agent` and `@task` decorators. The class loads agent and task configurations from the YAML files and defines the execution order.

* **main.py module**: We specified the input values (in this case, the motion) as a dictionary and launched the crew using `Debate().crew().kickoff(inputs=...)`.

* **Execution flow**: The `debater` agent generated arguments both in favor of and against the motion. The `judge` agent, using Anthropic Claude, evaluated the arguments and made a decision.

* **Result**: The full debate ran successfully. The final decision from the judge was printed in the console and saved to output files as defined in the task configuration.

This project demonstrates how to build and run a basic CrewAI application. You can now create new projects or expand this one by adding tools, agents, or more complex logic.



#### Recap: Your First Project with CrewAI


1. **Created the project:**

   ```bash
   crewai create crew debate
   ```

2. **Generated folder structure:**

   ```
   debate/
   ├── source/
   │   └── debate/
   │       ├── config/
   │       │   ├── agents.yaml
   │       │   └── tasks.yaml
   │       ├── crew.py
   │       └── main.py
   ```

3. **Defined the agents (`agents.yaml`):**
   Each agent includes: name, role, goal, backstory, and LLM.
   You used one `debater` agent and one `judge`.

4. **Defined the tasks (`tasks.yaml`):**
   Three tasks: `propose`, `oppose`, and `decide`, each assigned to an agent, with description and expected output.

5. **Implemented the logic in `crew.py`:**
   You used the decorators `@agent`, `@task`, and `@crew`.
   The crew ran in sequential order using `Process.sequential`.

6. **Ran the project:**

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

   The debate completed successfully, including a decision by the judge.

### What can you do next?

**Optional extension to practice:**

Split the `debater` into two agents, like this in `agents.yaml`:

```yaml
proposer:
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini

opposer:
  llm: deepseek-ai/deepseek-chat
```

Then update `tasks.yaml`:

```yaml
propose:
  agent: proposer
oppose:
  agent: opposer
```

This allows you to:

* Compare different LLMs (e.g., OpenAI vs DeepSeek, vs Claude)
* Alternate roles and measure consistency and persuasion
* Use a neutral judge and build your own leaderboard of model performance

**What does this teach you?**

* How to fully structure and run a CrewAI project from scratch
* How to plug in and test multiple models
* How to automate debates and measure persuasiveness

**Suggested next step**

You can build a notebook (e.g., `debate_leaderboard.ipynb`) that tests different combinations of models in debate roles and logs which model wins more often according to a judge.

Would you like a ready-made CrewAI project template that includes:

* two agents (`proposer` and `opposer`)
* a judge
* predefined model options
* auto-logging of decisions

Let me know the format you want: `.zip`, `.py`, `.yaml`, or `.ipynb`.

## Building Crew AI Projects: Tools, Context & Google Search Integration

To quickly recap what we did last time, we learned about an **agent**, the agent being the smallest autonomous unit. It has an LLM associated with it (although it doesn't actually need to — you can have an agent without an LLM, but they typically do). It has a **role**, a **goal**, a **backstory**, and it also has **memory** and **tools**, not that we've looked at either of them just yet.

And then a **task** — this is the concept which doesn't have an analogue in OpenAI Agent SDK. A task is an **assignment to be carried out** with a **description**, **expected output**, perhaps an **output file**, and it's **assigned to an agent**.

And then a **crew**, which is a **team of agents and tasks** together, assigned to those agents, and they can run **sequentially or hierarchically**, in which case you'd have to assign a manager LLM to figure out which task is assigned to which agent.

</p>


So that's the overall structure of Crew, which now should be pretty familiar to you.
And you'll remember that there are **five steps** that we went through when we set up our first crew project:

1. We created a project:

   ```bash
   crewai create crew my_project
   ```

2. We went into `source/my_project/config` and edited the YAML files for **agents** and **tasks**.

3. We edited `crew.py` to define the **agents**, **tasks**, and the **crew**, referencing the YAML config.

4. We updated `main.py` to define inputs — in our case, the **motion** for the debate.

5. We ran the crew with:

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

## Introducing the Second Project: Financial Researcher

Now we’re going to go a little bit deeper in two ways in our next project:

1. **Tools** – equipping agents with capabilities (something you're probably familiar with from other frameworks).
2. **Context** – passing information from one task to the next, CrewAI-style.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/18.png" width="500"/>
</p>

But first, let’s sign up for a powerful new tool that will allow our agents to access the web.

We’ll use **[Serper.dev](https://serper.dev)** — a lightning-fast and free API for Google search.

* Visit: [https://serper.dev](https://serper.dev)
* Sign up for an account (you’ll receive 2,500 free credits)
* Copy your API Key and paste it into your `.env` file as:

```env
SERPER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

> ⚠️ Don’t confuse **Serper.dev** with **SerpAPI** – they are different services!


Now let’s create our new project called `financial_researcher`:

**Defining our agents**. 

This block defines the researcher agent. Its role is to act as a Senior Financial Researcher for the given company. The agent’s goal is to research the company, find news, and assess its potential. The backstory describes the agent as someone skilled at identifying and presenting the most relevant information. The model assigned here is OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.

```yml

This block defines the analyst agent. Its job is to analyze the target company and write a comprehensive report. The backstory highlights the analyst’s meticulous approach and skill in turning research into valuable, clear insights. This agent also uses GPT-4o-mini.

```yml
analyst:
  role: >
    Market Analyst and Report writer focused on {company}
  goal: >
    Analyze company {company} and create a comprehensive, well-structured report
    that presents insights in a clear and engaging way
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous, skilled analyst with a background in financial analysis
    and company research. You have a talent for identifying patterns and extracting
    meaningful insights from research data, then communicating
    those insights through well crafted reports.

```

**Tasks Configuration**

The research task, assigned to the researcher, details what to investigate about the company (current status, history, challenges, opportunities, news, outlook). Findings should be well organized into clear sections.


```yml
# src/research_crew/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct thorough research on company {company}. Focus on:
    1. Current company status and health
    2. Historical company performance
    3. Major challenges and opportunities
    4. Recent news and events
    5. Future outlook and potential developments

    Make sure to organize your findings in a structured format with clear sections.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive research document with well-organized sections covering
    all the requested aspects of {company}. Include specific facts, figures,
    and examples where relevant.
  agent: researcher
```

The analysis task, assigned to the analyst, requires a report based on the research findings, including an executive summary, key information, insights, and a market outlook. The report must be professional and easy to read.
Importantly, the analysis task takes the research_task as its context, ensuring output continuity, and the result is saved to output/report.md.

```yml
analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the research findings and create a comprehensive report on {company}.
    Your report should:
    1. Begin with an executive summary
    2. Include all key information from the research
    3. Provide insightful analysis of trends and patterns
    4. Offer a market outlook for company, noting that this should not be used for trading decisions
    5. Be formatted in a professional, easy-to-read style with clear headings
  expected_output: >
    A polished, professional report on {company} that presents the research
    findings with added analysis and insights. The report should be well-structured
    with an executive summary, main sections, and conclusion.
  agent: analyst
  context:
    - research_task
  output_file: output/report.md
```

**Research `Crew.py` Implementation**

This file defines the `ResearchCrew class`, which wires up our agents and tasks.
* There are two agents: researcher and analyst.
* Two tasks: research_task and analysis_task.
* The crew runs the agents and tasks in a sequential process, meaning each task waits for the previous to finish, ensuring correct order and context passing.

```py
# src/financial_researcher/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class ResearchCrew():
    """Research crew for comprehensive topic analysis and reporting"""

    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
            verbose=True,
            tools=[SerperDevTool()]
        )

    @agent
    def analyst(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['analyst'],
            verbose=True
        )

    @task
    def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['research_task']
        )

    @task
    def analysis_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['analysis_task'],
            output_file='output/report.md'
        )

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the research crew"""
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

**`main.py` Script to Run the Crew**
* It ensures the output directory exists.
* Sets the company to be researched.
* Instantiates the ResearchCrew and kicks it off with the company input.
* Prints the result and confirms where the report was saved.


```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/financial_researcher/main.py
import os
from financial_researcher.crew import ResearchCrew

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('output', exist_ok=True)

def run():
    """
    Run the research crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'company': 'Apple'
    }

    # Create and run the crew
    result = ResearchCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)

    # Print the result
    print("\n\n=== FINAL REPORT ===\n\n")
    print(result.raw)

    print("\n\nReport has been saved to output/report.md")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

To run the workflow, open a terminal in the project folder and execute the command to start the process (e.g., crewai run). Inputs like the company name will be assigned automatically, and you’ll see the research agent take on the assigned task. Some models may be slower but provide more detailed research.

The process is set to sequential, and all verbose output is enabled for transparency.

**Why context matters and the problem with knowledge cutoffs**

The key point is that the second agent, which generated the summary of the research report on Tesla, could do so effectively because it received the output from the first agent as its context. This is how it was able to produce a relevant summary. However, if you look at the details, you will notice the information was current only up to October 2023, such as the mention of “Key Financial Metrics Q3 2023.” This is disappointing, since it's not recent data. The reason for this is that we relied on the research agent, which used DeepSeek, and DeepSeek was last trained in 2023. It cannot provide more up-to-date information.

**How to fix outdated research with tools**

To solve this problem, you can add a tool that enables real-time search. The plan is to return to `crew.py`, the module where the crew is defined, and add a new import from crew\.ai tools. Specifically, you want to use the SERPA.dev tool. This tool lets the agent perform Google lookups using your SERPA.dev API key, which must be added to your `.env` file.


**Assigning the search tool to the researcher agent**

The next step is to ensure only the researcher agent has access to the SERPA.dev tool. This is done by adding the tool to the researcher's `tools` list when you create the agent instance. The implementation is simple: instantiate the SERPA.dev tool and include it in the researcher’s configuration. Only the researcher should have access; the analyst does not need it.


**Running the process with the new tool**

Once this change is saved, you can switch the LLM model if you wish— for speed, you might select OpenAI GPT-4o Mini. Then, open a terminal, navigate to your financial researcher directory, and run the workflow with `crew.ai run`.


**Observing up-to-date results**

Now, when the workflow executes, the researcher agent will use the SERPA.dev tool to search Google for up-to-date information, such as “Tesla latest news today.” The process includes multiple searches and gathers recent information— for example, results from 2025 appear in the search, showing you are now getting the latest data.

The researcher completes the data collection, then hands off to the report writer agent (using, for example, Grok). The summary and final report now include the most current news about Tesla, including events from the last month or even last week. The final report is clear, accurate, and highly relevant.


**Key takeaways and advantages**

* The infrastructure is easy to build with Crew: just a few commands and clear YAML objectives for each agent and task.
* Assigning tools to agents (like SERPA.dev to the researcher) is straightforward.
* The costs are low or even free if you use the available credits.
* The system now produces high-quality, up-to-date reports with very little manual effort.
* The resulting reports are comparable to what a human would produce after 10–15 minutes of focused research and synthesis.

> With these improvements, your automated financial researcher can gather and report the latest information, not just rely on LLM training cutoffs. Crew makes it simple to connect tools, agents, and tasks, and enables experimentation with different models and tool assignments for better results.

## `Stock Picker`

**Project Overview and Build Steps**

Time to build a new project: **Stock Picker**—a tool for generating stock market recommendations (for learning and experimentation only, not for live trading).
Remember the five basic CRU project build steps:

1. Use `crewai create crew` to scaffold the project.
2. Fill in the YAML files (agents and tasks).
3. Complete the `crew.py` module.
4. Update `main.py` to set any needed run inputs.
5. Run the project using `crewai run`.

For this project, we'll deepen the process in three new ways:

* Use structured outputs (revisit from last week).
* Add a custom tool (in addition to the SERPA tool).
* Try out the hierarchical process (allowing CRU to manage what tasks go where).

**Setting Up the Project**

Open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and run:

```sh
crewai create crew
```

Name the project **Stock Picker**.
Select OpenAI as your provider, pick GPT-4 and Mini, skip M variables.
CRU creates the project for you.

Now, open the Stock Picker folder, navigate to `src/config`, and start by defining your agents.

**Agents (`src/config/agents.yaml`)**

The Stock Picker project uses four agents, each with a specific financial or management role:

**Trending Company Finder:** Finds 2-3 trending companies in the news for a given sector. Ensures new companies are picked each time, based on latest news.

```yml
trending_company_finder:
  role: >
    Financial News Analyst that finds trending companies in {sector}
  goal: >
    You read the latest news, then find 2-3 companies that are trending in the news for further research.
    Always pick new companies. Don't pick the same company twice.
  backstory: >
    You are a market expert with a knack for picking out the most interesting companies based on latest news.
    You spot multiple companies that are trending in the news.
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini
```
**Financial Researcher:**
Given the trending companies, provides detailed, expert analysis of each one in a structured report.

```yml
financial_researcher:
  role: >
    Senior Financial Researcher
  goal: >
    Given details of trending companies in the news, you provide comprehensive analysis of each in a report.
  backstory: >
    You are a financial expert with a proven track record of deeply analyzing hot companies and building comprehensive reports.
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

**Stock Picker:**
Given all research, picks the single best company for investment. Notifies the user and provides a detailed report. Avoids duplicate picks.

```yml
stock_picker:
  role: >
    Stock Picker from Research
  goal: >
    Given a list of researched companies with investment potential, you select the best one for investment,
    notifying the user and then providing a detailed report. Don't pick the same company twice.
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous, skilled financial analyst with a proven track record of equity selection.
    You have a talent for synthesizing research and picking the best company for investment.
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini
```
**Manager:**
A simple agent responsible for overseeing and delegating tasks, aiming to get the best investment pick.


```yml
manager:
  role: >
    Manager
  goal: >
    You are a skilled project manager who can delegate tasks in order to achieve your goal, which is to pick the best company for investment.
  backstory: >
    You are an experienced and highly effective project manager who can delegate tasks to the right people.
  llm: openai/gpt-4o
```


**Tasks (`src/config/tasks.yaml`)**

Each task is written to be clear and direct, using consistent language (like "trending companies") throughout agents and tasks for stability and coherence.

**Find Trending Companies Task:**
The trending company finder agent searches the latest news in the given sector, outputs a list of new trending companies (never repeats), and saves results to `output/trending_companies.json`.
The output is structured as JSON for clarity and later use.

```yml
find_trending_companies:
  description: >
    Find the top trending companies in the news in {sector} by searching the latest news. Find new companies that you've not found before.
  expected_output: >
    A list of trending companies in {sector}
  agent: trending_company_finder
  output_file: output/trending_companies.json
```

**Research Trending Companies Task:**
The financial researcher agent takes the trending company list and generates a report with a detailed analysis for each, saved to `output/research_report.json`.
This task uses the output from the previous task as its context.

```yml
research_trending_companies:
  description: >
    Given a list of trending companies, provide detailed analysis of each company in a report by searching online
  expected_output: >
    A report containing detailed analysis of each company
  agent: financial_researcher
  context:
    - find_trending_companies
  output_file: output/research_report.json
```

**Pick Best Company Task:**
The stock picker analyzes all research and picks the best company. It sends a push notification to the user with a brief rationale, and then gives a full report including why that company was chosen and why others were not. Results are saved to `output/decision.md`.

```yml
pick_best_company:
  description: >
    Analyze the research findings and pick the best company for investment.
    Send a push notification to the user with the decision and 1 sentence rationale.
    Then respond with a detailed report on why you chose this company, and which companies were not selected.
  expected_output: >
    The chosen company and why it was chosen; the companies that were not selected and why they were not selected.
  agent: stock_picker
  context:
    - research_trending_companies
  output_file: output/decision.md
```

**Tips and Notes from Experience**

* Each agent/task pair is well-matched; there's currently a one-to-one mapping.
* Writing very crisp, instructive task descriptions and consistent language helps produce more coherent results.
* In earlier versions, inconsistent wording between tasks and agents led to confusion and less stable results.
* Structured outputs (like JSON and MD files) make it easier to consume results and pass them between agents.

**Next Steps**

After agents and tasks are defined, proceed to implement the process in `crew.py` and set up input handling in `main.py`, then run your project and review the outputs.
You can experiment with different models for each agent, or add custom tools as needed to expand capabilities (for example, integrating notifications or news scraping tools).
Remember, this workflow is for educational and research purposes only, not for live trading or investment advice.

**`crew.py`**

**Structured Outputs with Pydantic Schemas**

We now want each task to output structured information using JSON schemas. This is achieved by creating Python classes that subclass `BaseModel` from Pydantic. Each schema makes clear what the output must contain, guiding the agent’s answers and ensuring outputs are predictable and robust.

For example, for trending companies:

The **TrendingCompany** class defines the attributes we want for each trending company. **TrendingCompanyList** is simply a list of these companies. This approach helps downstream agents and tasks consume the output easily.

```py
class TrendingCompany(BaseModel):
"""A company that is in the news and attracting attention"""
name: str = Field(description="Company name")
ticker: str = Field(description="Stock ticker symbol")
reason: str = Field(description="Reason this company is trending in the news")

class TrendingCompanyList(BaseModel):
"""List of multiple trending companies that are in the news"""
companies: List\[TrendingCompany] = Field(description="List of companies trending in the news")
```

Similarly, for research results:

```py
class TrendingCompanyResearch(BaseModel):
"""Detailed research on a company"""
name: str = Field(description="Company name")
market\_position: str = Field(description="Current market position and competitive analysis")
future\_outlook: str = Field(description="Future outlook and growth prospects")
investment\_potential: str = Field(description="Investment potential and suitability for investment")

class TrendingCompanyResearchList(BaseModel):
"""A list of detailed research on all the companies"""
research\_list: List\[TrendingCompanyResearch] = Field(description="Comprehensive research on all trending companies")
```

Each output is tightly specified, so the agents are “on rails” for their outputs.


**Defining the StockPicker Crew**

Now, define the StockPicker crew in `crew.py`. This class pulls in your YAML configs, creates agents, assigns tasks, and sets up the process to be hierarchical, meaning the manager agent can delegate tasks to others.

```py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List
```

**Agent Definitions**

* **Trending Company Finder**: Uses SERPA tool to find trending companies.
* **Financial Researcher**: Uses SERPA tool to research those companies.
* **Stock Picker**: Uses a push notification tool, gets research, and selects the best company.
* **Manager**: A special agent allowed to delegate tasks, using a more capable model (GPT-4o for better performance, but you may use Mini for cost).

**Task Definitions**

* **find\_trending\_companies**: Returns data matching `TrendingCompanyList`.
* **research\_trending\_companies**: Returns data matching `TrendingCompanyResearchList`.
* **pick\_best\_company**: Selects the top company and explains why.

**Example Implementation:**
```py
@CrewBase
class StockPicker():
"""StockPicker crew"""

agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'
tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'

@agent
def trending_company_finder(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(config=self.agents_config['trending_company_finder'],
                 tools=[SerperDevTool()], memory=True)

@agent
def financial_researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(config=self.agents_config['financial_researcher'], 
                 tools=[SerperDevTool()])

@agent
def stock_picker(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(config=self.agents_config['stock_picker'], 
                 tools=[PushNotificationTool()])

@task
def find_trending_companies(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['find_trending_companies'],
        output_pydantic=TrendingCompanyList,
    )

@task
def research_trending_companies(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['research_trending_companies'],
        output_pydantic=TrendingCompanyResearchList,
    )

@task
def pick_best_company(self) -> Task:
    return Task(
        config=self.tasks_config['pick_best_company'],
    )
```

**Hierarchical Process and Delegation**

Instead of running tasks sequentially, set up a hierarchical process where the **manager agent** decides which agent performs which task and in what order. This enables flexible, dynamic workflows where some tasks can even be skipped or run multiple times if needed.

```py
@crew
def crew(self) -> Crew:
"""Creates the StockPicker crew"""

manager = Agent(
    config=self.agents_config['manager'],
    allow_delegation=True
)
    
return Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks, 
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    verbose=True,
    manager_agent=manager
)
```

* **Manager agent** is created separately with `allow_delegation=True`, which means it can assign work to other agents.
* The **process** is set to hierarchical, not sequential.
* Verbose mode is on for debugging and tracking.
* Three types of memory (long-term, short-term, entity) are configured for better context retention and learning.

**Best Practices and Observations**

* The fourth agent (manager) is not part of the regular task team, but is used as the project overseer.
* You may define the manager directly as an LLM, but it works better if you define an agent with an explicit role and goal.
* Using larger models (like GPT-4o) for the manager yields better coherence, but increases cost.
* Consistent naming and output schemas boost system stability and make downstream integration easier.

│  After careful analysis of the three companies—OpenAI, Meta Platforms, Inc., and Microsoft Corporation—I've concluded that Microsoft Corporation presents the best investment opportunity    │
│  based on the criteria of market position, future outlook, and investment potential.                                                                                                         │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │
│  1. **Market Position**: Microsoft is a well-established leader in multiple sectors, including software (Windows, Office), cloud computing (Azure), and hardware (Surface). Its diversified  │
│  portfolio mitigates risks associated with relying on a single revenue stream. Furthermore, Microsoft's long-standing reputation and brand equity give it a competitive advantage.           │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │
│  2. **Future Outlook**: Microsoft has been making significant strides in the cloud computing market with Azure, which is set to continue growing as more businesses transition to            │
│  cloud-based solutions. The integration of AI technologies into its existing products, including recent developments in OpenAI partnerships, positions Microsoft at the forefront of         │
│  innovation. Analysts predict growth rates between 15-20% annually for Azure over the next 5 years, signifying robust future prospects.                                                      │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │
│  3. **Investment Potential**: Microsoft has shown consistent revenue growth, impressive margins, and a strong balance sheet. The company's financial health allows it to invest heavily in   │

│  After careful analysis of the three companies—OpenAI, Meta Platforms, Inc., and Microsoft Corporation—I've concluded that Microsoft Corporation presents the best investment opportunity    │
│  based on the criteria of market position, future outlook, and investment potential.                                                                                                         │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │
│  1. **Market Position**: Microsoft is a well-established leader in multiple sectors, including software (Windows, Office), cloud computing (Azure), and hardware (Surface). Its diversified  │
│  portfolio mitigates risks associated with relying on a single revenue stream. Furthermore, Microsoft's long-standing reputation and brand equity give it a competitive advantage.           │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │
│  2. **Future Outlook**: Microsoft has been making significant strides in the cloud computing market with Azure, which is set to continue growing as more businesses transition to            │
│  cloud-based solutions. The integration of AI technologies into its existing products, including recent developments in OpenAI partnerships, positions Microsoft at the forefront of         │
│  innovation. Analysts predict growth rates between 15-20% annually for Azure over the next 5 years, signifying robust future prospects.                                                      │

│  3. **Investment Potential**: Microsoft has shown consistent revenue growth, impressive margins, and a strong balance sheet. The company's financial health allows it to invest heavily in   │
│  R&D and acquisitions, enhancing its competitive edge. Furthermore, Microsoft has a history of returning value to its shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, yielding an         │
│  attractive total return profile for investors.                                                                                                                                              │

│  Why it was chosen: Microsoft Corporation presents the best investment opportunity based on its strong market position, favorable future outlook, and robust investment potential. It is a   │
│  well-established leader with a diversified portfolio, significant strides in cloud computing, and strategic integration of AI technologies. Microsoft has consistent revenue growth,        │
│  impressive margins, and a strong financial position allowing investments in R&D and acquisitions. Additionally, it offers attractive total returns through dividends and stock buybacks.    │
│                                                                                                                                                                                              │

│  1. OpenAI                                                                                                                                                                                   │
│  Why not selected: Although OpenAI shows promising innovation potential, it is still a private entity with nascent financial capabilities compared to Microsoft. The company lacks the       │
│  stability and extensive revenue streams of established publicly traded firms.                                                                                                               │

Block 1 – Structured Outputs
We implemented structured outputs by requiring all tasks to respond using a predefined JSON schema. This ensured consistency and allowed downstream processing to be more robust and predictable.

Block 2 – Hierarchical Process
Instead of using a sequential task execution flow, we adopted a hierarchical model. Tasks could be assigned either by passing a model name directly or by using an agent responsible for delegating subtasks to other agents. This demonstrated both benefits and drawbacks in execution flow and control.

Block 3 – Custom Tool Integration
We introduced a custom-built tool: a push notification sender. An agent was equipped with this functionality and executed it successfully, showcasing the system’s extensibility and modularity.

Block 4 – Project Status and Next Steps
Although this wraps up the work for today, the stock picker project is not yet complete. Additional enhancements ("bells and whistles") are planned for tomorrow. The focus will then shift to the upcoming developer agent project, which will expand capabilities further.

Block 5 – Recap and Transition
Today’s session covered three core elements: structured outputs, hierarchical task assignment, and integration of a custom tool. Tomorrow will continue with enhancements and move into the next phase.

## Memory - more prescriptive

Perfect. Here's the improved and structured version of your text, **without losing any words**, and with each part **labeled with a period title** (`Part 1.`, `Part 2.`, etc.). No icons, no schematic lists, just clear blocks:

**Final Touches to the Stock Picker and Transition to Developer Agent**

We did a stock picker project, and we still have a tiny bit left to add to it before moving on to our next project, the developer agent. But before that, let's go over some fundamentals again. I know it may seem repetitive, but repetition helps solidify the process.

**The Five Steps to Building a CRU Project**

Building a CRU project involves five main steps. First, we use `cruai create cru <project_name>` to scaffold the project. This command sets up the directories and initial files.

Second, we locate the YAML files for agents and tasks, where we define the agents’ roles and their responsibilities.

Third, we move to the `crew.py` module, where we instantiate the agents and tasks using decorators, and construct the crew itself. This is also where structured outputs are defined using JSON schemas to ensure consistent and validated agent responses. Additionally, within this file we can equip agents with tools—both built-in ones like Serpa (a remote search tool), and custom tools like the one we wrote to send push notifications.

Fourth, we update the `main.py` script to handle user inputs and bind them to the templated fields in the task definitions.

And finally, we execute the project using `cruai run`.


**PIntroduction to Memory in CRU**

Now, let’s cover a new feature in CRU: memory. This is a slightly more opinionated part of the CRU framework. Memory, in this context, refers to how contextual information is provided to LLMs during execution.

In CRU, you can manage memory manually by storing variables and passing them into tasks. However, CRU also offers built-in constructs for memory, which bring certain advantages—mainly ease of use and prebuilt logic—but they also introduce trade-offs, such as added abstraction and reduced visibility into what's happening under the hood.


**Embracing CRU's Memory Framework**

Let’s say we embrace CRU’s approach to memory. There are five kinds of memory constructs you can include.

* **short-term memory**, which stores recent interactions in a vector database using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This allows agents to access the most relevant recent information during execution.

* **long-term memory**, which stores more important or persistent information in a SQL database, allowing knowledge to accumulate over time.

* **entity memory**, which is quite similar to short-term memory but focuses on storing data about people, places, and key concepts. It also uses a vector database for similarity search and is useful for retrieving contextualized entity information.

* **contextual memory**, which CRU lists as a separate type, though it's arguably just a combination of the three previous memory types. It allows these different memories to be queried and injected into prompts as context automatically. This makes memory integration very straightforward with just a few lines of code, though again, at the cost of losing some control and debuggability.

**The Special Case of User Memory**

Finally, there is **user memory**, designed for storing user-specific information. This one stands out because, although CRU acknowledges it and provides some framework support, it still requires manual management in most cases. You are expected to handle querying and injecting user memory data yourself when building tasks.


**Focus of Upcoming Code: Contextual Memory in Stock Picker**

In the code we're about to explore, we’ll be focusing primarily on contextual memory, meaning we’ll see how short-term, long-term, and entity memory are integrated into the stock picker solution to give our agents more meaningful, persistent awareness throughout the session.
