## Crew AI

This marks a transition from the familiar **OpenAI Agents SDK** to the world of **Crew AI**. Although the shift may feel abrupt, it's part of an ongoing process of exploring different agent frameworks. Each one offers unique perspectives and tools, and each will be more or less suited depending on the project at hand.

You’re encouraged to:

* Note the similarities and differences between frameworks.
* Decide for yourself which tool best suits your needs.
* Learn something valuable from each one.


**What Is Crew AI?**

**Crew AI** refers to multiple things, depending on context. These include:

**1. Crew AI Enterprise**

Also called the **Crew AI Platform**, this is a commercial platform for:

* Deploying agents
* Monitoring agent behavior
* Managing workflows through various dashboards

You can visit it at: **crewai.com** (not **crew\.ai**)

**2. Crew AI UI Studio**

A **low-code/no-code** tool for:

* Building agent interactions visually
* Allowing end-users to create workflows without coding

**3. Crew AI Framework**

An **open-source** Python framework built for:

> “Orchestrating high-performing AI agents with ease and scale.”

This is the focus of the course: writing code and building agents from scratch using the open-source framework, not the commercial tools.


**Commercial Strategy of Crew AI**

Unlike OpenAI or Anthropic (which monetize via their LLMs), Crew AI:

* Needs a business model built around its tooling
* Offers the **free framework** as entry
* Monetizes through **hosting**, **deployment**, and **enterprise tools**

This is why the website includes heavy upselling — it aims to convert open-source users into paying enterprise customers.


**Two Modes in the Crew AI Framework**

Once inside the open-source framework, there are **two major approaches**:

**1. Crew AI Cruise**

* Teams of agents collaborating
* Roles are assigned to different agents
* Supports **autonomous**, **creative**, or **exploratory** solutions
* Suitable for agentic, unscripted workflows

“Crew” = A team of agents working together

**2. Crew AI Flows**

* Structured and linear workflows
* Tasks are broken into **deterministic steps**
* Includes decision points and expected outcomes
* Useful for **auditability**, **control**, or **predictable behavior**

This is likely a newer addition, possibly a response to concerns about the unpredictability of Cruise-style setups in production environments.


**When to Use Each Mode**

| Mode       | Best For                                                              |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cruise** | Autonomous problem-solving, creative collaboration, exploratory tasks |
| **Flows**  | Deterministic workflows, precision, audit trails                      |


## Core Concepts of Crew AI

**Agent**

An **agent** is the smallest autonomous unit in Crew AI. It is linked to an LLM and includes:

* **Role**: A description of what the agent does
* **Goal**: The purpose or objective of the agent
* **Backstory**: Context or background information for priming
* **Memory**: Optional storage for past interactions
* **Tools**: Optional tools the agent can use

Agents resemble those in OpenAI Agents SDK but are more prescriptive: instead of a single `instruction`, Crew AI uses multiple structured fields (role, goal, backstory).

**Task**

A **task** is a unit of work assigned to an agent. It includes:

* **Description**: What the task is
* **Expected Output**: The desired result
* **Agent**: The agent responsible for executing it

Tasks are a new construct, not present in OpenAI Agents SDK, and help separate logic from behavior.

**Crew**

A **crew** is a combination of:

* Multiple **agents**
* Multiple **tasks**

It defines how agents and tasks work together to solve a problem.

Crew can operate in two modes:

* **Sequential**: Tasks are executed in a defined order
* **Hierarchical**: A manager LLM dynamically assigns tasks to agents

---

**Comparison with OpenAI Agents SDK**

Crew AI is:

* **More opinionated**: Requires structured agent configuration
* **More prescriptive**: Enforces concepts like roles and backstories
* **Less transparent**: The system prompt is generated from multiple fields rather than a single `instruction`, which can make debugging more complex
* **Configurable**: Uses YAML to separate configuration from code

**Configuration via YAML**

Crew AI supports agent and task configuration via YAML files.
Advantages:

* **Separation of concerns**: Prompts and configuration are outside the main Python code
* **Easier to manage**: Especially for larger projects with many agents
* **Readable**: YAML is easy for humans to read and write

You can create agents by:

* Writing code: `Agent(...)`
* Referring to a YAML configuration: e.g. `"config.agent_config['researcher']"

**Python Structure: `crew.py`**

This is the main module where agents, tasks, and crews are defined.

**Decorators**

Crew AI uses decorators to structure the code:

| Decorator    | Purpose                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@crew_base` | Marks the main class managing the crew         |
| `@agent`     | Decorates a method that defines an agent       |
| `@task`      | Decorates a method that defines a task         |
| `@crew`      | Decorates the function that assembles the crew |

These decorators:

* Register agents and tasks automatically
* Allow referencing `self.agents`, `self.tasks` in the final crew assembly
* Specify mode (`sequential` or `hierarchical`) within the `@crew` function



## LightLLM and CrewAI Project Setup

CrewAI uses **LightLLM**, a minimal and ultra-flexible framework, to connect with any LLM. Unlike heavier frameworks like LangChain, LightLLM allows you to:

* Connect instantly to hosted or local LLMs
* Use almost any provider or model
* Configure access easily in code or `.env` files

**Example usage**

```python
llm = LLM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
llm = LLM(model="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
llm = LLM(model="gemini/gemini-2-0-flash")
llm = LLM(model="groq/llama-3-70b-versatile")
llm = LLM(model="ollama/llama3.2", base_url="http://localhost:11434")
llm = LLM(
    model="openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1",
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=OPENROUTER_API_KEY
)
```

* The model format: `"provider/model"`
* Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, OpenRouter, etc.
* Can also run local models (e.g., via Ollama)



## LightLLM and Model Flexibility in CrewAI

One of the key advantages of CrewAI is its lightweight and flexible way of interacting with LLMs. Under the hood, it uses a framework called LightLLM. LightLLM is a very minimalistic and straightforward tool to interface with actual LLM providers. The speaker likes LightLLM a lot because of its simplicity and lack of overhead, especially compared to frameworks like LangChain, which add a lot of structure.

LightLLM allows you to connect to any LLM easily. In CrewAI, you just create an LLM by passing a model name. The naming structure follows this pattern: provider name followed by a slash, then the model name. This makes it easy to switch between different providers and models.

Examples include GPT-4 from OpenAI, Claude from Anthropic, 3.5 and 3.7 versions, Gemini, Flash, Grok (with a “Q” or a “K”), and local models using Ollama. For local models, you can configure them by providing a base URL. You can also use OpenRouter, which acts as an abstraction layer over multiple LLMs. Configuring OpenRouter involves setting a base URL and an API key.

The idea behind all of this is to provide a simple and flexible system for connecting to any model you need. The speaker believes this gives CrewAI a clear advantage over OpenAI Agents SDK, which is more tightly coupled to a specific provider.


## Structure and Workflow of a CrewAI Project

The next major topic is how CrewAI handles projects. In earlier weeks of the course, everything was done inside Python notebooks (like in Cursor), or occasionally through basic Python modules. CrewAI, however, does not work that way. It requires working with actual Python code and comes with its own project and directory structure.

The CrewAI framework has already been installed using this command:

```bash
uv tool install crewai
```

That means when you clone the repo, the framework is already available.

To create a new Crew project, you use this command:

```bash
crewai create crew my_crew
```

You can name the project whatever you want. For example, “my\_crew” or “my\_project.”

Alternatively, if you want to work with flows instead of crews (i.e., fixed workflows rather than agent-based ones), you can use:

```bash
crewai create flow my_project
```

However, in the course, the focus is on crews, not flows.

Running the `crewai create crew` command generates a full directory structure. At the top level is the project directory, such as `my_crew`. Inside that is a subdirectory called `src`. Within `src`, there is another directory with the name of your project, such as `my_crew` again.


```bash

7 directories, 10 files
```

**Inside debate/:**

Contains a subfolder: `knowledge/`
* File: user_preference.yaml
* Contains user-specific background info.
* Used to pass context to the model (not used in this example).
```bash
(agents_env) ➜  week3_crew git:(main) cat debate/knowledge/user_preference.txt
User name is John Doe.
User is an AI Engineer.
User is interested in AI Agents.
User is based in San Francisco, California.
```

**source/ Folder**:

Path: `debate/source/debate/`

This nested structure exists because the project name is also **debate**.  

Subfolder: `config/` This folder contains two YAML files by default:
* `agents.yaml`, where you define agent configurations.
* `tasks.yaml`, where you define task configurations.
* Both with defeault examples.

Subfolder: `tools/`
* Empty or with placeholder code
* For adding custom tools later (not used in this example)

Python files:  
Also in the same directory are two important Python modules:
* `crew.py`, which is where you define your crew using decorators.
* `main.py`, which is the script that starts the execution of your crew.

```sh
mkdir other # ← optional dummy folder to make VS Code show tree view properly
```

#### Now we going to define our files

**`agents.yaml`** :

And this contains some default, some sort of scaffolding, some example agents that are called the Researcher and the Reporting Analyst are the two examples it's given and we're going to change these to being what we're looking to build, and of course **we're looking to build a little debate team**, and in fact we only need **two agents** for what we're looking to do. We want an agent that will be the debater. One agent is going to play both roles of being for and against the motion 

```yaml
debater:
  role: >
    A compelling debater
  goal: >
    Present a clear argument either in favor of or against the motion. The motion is: {motion}
```
So now we have a back story... you're an experienced debater with a knack for giving concise but convincing arguments. You can also specify what model to use... GPT-40 Mini... or OpenAI/GPT-40 Mini...

```yaml
  backstory: >
    You're an experienced debator with a knack for giving concise but convincing arguments.
    The motion is: {motion}
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini
```
> Note : the `{motion}` fields acts as a dynamic template that will in `main.py`

But now let’s define our judge... the role we will say is decide the winner of the debate.. 

```yaml
judge:
  role: >
    Decide the winner of the debate based on the arguments presented
  goal: >
    Given arguments for and against this motion: {motion}, decide which side is more convincing,
    based purely on the arguments presented.
```

You’re a fair judge with a reputation for weighing up arguments without factoring in your own views... You can just have GPT-40 Mini, or... anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest...

```yaml
  backstory: >
    You are a fair judge with a reputation for weighing up arguments without factoring in
    your own views, and making a decision based purely on the merits of the argument.
    The motion is: {motion}
  llm: anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest
```

**`tasks.yaml`**:

The first task is to propose the motion — that is, give a strong argument in favor of it.
This task is assigned to the debater agent. 

```yaml
propose:
  description: >
    You are proposing the motion: {motion}.
    Come up with a clear argument in favor of the motion.
    Be very convincing.
  expected_output: >
    Your clear argument in favor of the motion, in a concise manner.
  agent: debater
  output_file: output/propose.md
```

The second task is to oppose the motion — that is, produce a strong argument against it.
Again, the same debater agent is used, but now in oposición.

```yaml
oppose:
  description: >
    You are in opposition to the motion: {motion}.
    Come up with a clear argument against the motion.
    Be very convincing.
  expected_output: >
    Your clear argument against the motion, in a concise manner.
  agent: debater
  output_file: output/oppose.md
```
Finally, the judge reviews the arguments and makes a decision about which side is more convincing.

```yaml
decide:
  description: >
    Review the arguments presented by the debaters and decide which side is more convincing.
  expected_output: >
    Your decision on which side is more convincing, and why.
  agent: judge
  output_file: output/decide.md
```

final result:

```yaml
propose  →  debater  →  output/propose.md
oppose   →  debater  →  output/oppose.md
decide   →  judge    →  output/decide.md
```

**`crew.py`**:

So this is the default module crew.py and you can see it's got some stuff in here based on the standard scaffolding.
It has created a class and it's got this crew base decorator around it and this class is named the same as the name of our project: Debate. 

It brings in the agents config and the tasks config from the config folder. You can see how it refers directly to our configuration...

```py
@CrewBase
class Debate():
    """Debate crew"""

    agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml'
    tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml'

```
We don’t have an agent called researcher, we have debater. The @agent decorator tells CrewAI this method defines an agent.

```py
    @agent
    def debater(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['debater'],
            verbose=True
        )
    @agent
    def judge(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['judge'],
            verbose=True
        )
```
And now we’re going to define our tasks.
First propose, then oppose, and finally decide.

```py
    @task
    def propose(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['propose'],
        )

    @task
    def oppose(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['oppose'],
        )

    @task
    def decide(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['decide'],
        )
```

So those are our two agents and three tasks...
And now we define the Crew object that puts it all together.

```py
    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the Debate crew"""

        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,  # autogenerado por los métodos @agent
            tasks=self.tasks,    # autogenerado por los métodos @task
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

**`main.py`**

This main file is intended to run your crew locally, so refrain from adding unnecessary logic.

So inputs, when we’re running the crew, this is where we choose those template values that we put in our YAML file.

```py
inputs = {
    'motion': 'There needs to be strict laws to regulate LLMs',
}
```
We should now be ready to run our first crew just based on that.

```py
result = Debate().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
print(result.raw)
```
--- 

#### Run the project

```bash
crewai run

Internally, this runs:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

```bash

│  Furthermore, LLMs pose privacy concerns, as they can potentially generate personal or sensitive         │
│  information without consent. Regulations can help define the boundaries of acceptable use, thus         │
│  protecting individuals’ rights and privacy.                                                             │

│  While the concerns surrounding large language models (LLMs) are valid, imposing strict laws to          │
│  regulate them can stifle innovation, impede progress, and limit their potential benefits for society.   │
│  Here are several compelling arguments against the motion:                                               │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Firstly, overregulation can hinder technological advancement. The rapid development of LLMs has led to  │
│  groundbreaking applications across various fields, including healthcare, education, and content         │
│  creation. Imposing strict laws may create barriers to innovation, preventing beneficial advancements    │
│  that could significantly improve lives and societal functions.                                          │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Secondly, the implementation of strict laws may disproportionately affect smaller companies and         │
│  startups that lack the resources to comply with extensive regulatory frameworks. This could further     │
│  entrench the dominance of larger corporations, limiting diversity and competition in the field. A more  │
│  nuanced approach that encourages responsible development while still permitting creativity and growth   │
│  is necessary.                                                                                           │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Additionally, while concerns about misinformation and bias are important, it is essential to recognize  │
│  that humans are ultimately responsible for the use of these technologies. Rather than creating rigid    │
│  laws, we should focus on developing guidelines that promote ethical use and enhance digital literacy    │
│  among users. Empowering individuals with knowledge and skills will lead to more responsible engagement  │
│  with LLMs than strict regulations ever could.                                                           │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Moreover, the technology itself is evolving rapidly. Regulations that may seem appropriate today can    │
│  quickly become outdated as the landscape changes. A flexible regulatory framework that adapts to        │
│  technological advancements is far more pragmatic than strict laws that may struggle to keep pace.       │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Lastly, collaboration between developers, ethicists, and the community can lead to better outcomes      │
│  than stringent legislation. By fostering open dialogue and shared best practices, we can mitigate       │
│  risks while still allowing for the exploration of new ideas and methodologies.                          │
│                                                                                                          │
│  In conclusion, while addressing the challenges posed by LLMs is necessary, strict laws are not the      │
│  solution. We should prioritize fostering innovation, encouraging responsible use, and adapting our      │
│  approach to regulation in line with the evolving nature of technology. An overbearing legal framework   │
│  risks stifling the significant benefits that LLMs have to offer, ultimately hindering progress and      │
│  societal advancement.                                                                                   │

│  After thoroughly evaluating the arguments presented for and against the motion that strict laws need    │
│  to be established to regulate large language models (LLMs), the case for imposing such laws is          │
│  ultimately more convincing.                                                                             │
│                                                                                                          │
│  The arguments in favor highlight several critical points that underscore the necessity of regulation.   │
│  First and foremost, the proliferation of misleading and false information generated by LLMs carries     │
│  significant risks—not only to individual users but broadly to societal trust and cohesion. Without      │
│  regulation, these technologies could exacerbate misinformation and create division among communities,   │
│  potentially influencing public opinion in detrimental ways.                                             │
│                                                                                                          │
│  Moreover, the issue of bias in LLMs cannot be understated. The recognition that these models can        │
│  perpetuate existing biases present in training data raises ethical concerns that impact marginalized    │
│  populations. Establishing strict laws would foster accountability in the development and deployment of  │
│  LLM technology, ensuring a more ethical approach that protects vulnerable groups.                       │
│                                                                                                          │

agents_env➜  debate git:(main) ✗
```

This setup creates a complete UV (micro) project. So when you run `crewai create crew`, it automatically generates UV project configuration files. These UV projects will be nested within the larger UV project that contains the entire course. This structure will become more intuitive once you see it in practice.


```bash
(agents_env) ➜  my_agents git:(main) tree notebooks/week3_crew/debate/output
notebooks/week3_crew/debate/output
├── decide.md
├── oppose.md
└── propose.md
```

**Final Note Before Practice**

The course is now ready to start using CrewAI hands-on. Everything is set up with UV, CrewAI is installed, and the directory structure has been generated. The next step is to go ahead and actually try it out by building your own crew.

In this first project using **CrewAI**, we successfully completed a full execution cycle of a crew of agents designed to simulate an automated debate using LLMs.

* **YAML configuration**: We defined the agents (`debater` and `judge`) and tasks (`propose`, `oppose`, `decide`) in the `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files.

* **crew\.py module**: We created the main crew class using the `@agent` and `@task` decorators. The class loads agent and task configurations from the YAML files and defines the execution order.

* **main.py module**: We specified the input values (in this case, the motion) as a dictionary and launched the crew using `Debate().crew().kickoff(inputs=...)`.

* **Execution flow**: The `debater` agent generated arguments both in favor of and against the motion. The `judge` agent, using Anthropic Claude, evaluated the arguments and made a decision.

* **Result**: The full debate ran successfully. The final decision from the judge was printed in the console and saved to output files as defined in the task configuration.

This project demonstrates how to build and run a basic CrewAI application. You can now create new projects or expand this one by adding tools, agents, or more complex logic.



#### Recap: Your First Project with CrewAI


1. **Created the project:**

   ```bash
   crewai create crew debate
   ```

2. **Generated folder structure:**

   ```
   debate/
   ├── source/
   │   └── debate/
   │       ├── config/
   │       │   ├── agents.yaml
   │       │   └── tasks.yaml
   │       ├── crew.py
   │       └── main.py
   ```

3. **Defined the agents (`agents.yaml`):**
   Each agent includes: name, role, goal, backstory, and LLM.
   You used one `debater` agent and one `judge`.

4. **Defined the tasks (`tasks.yaml`):**
   Three tasks: `propose`, `oppose`, and `decide`, each assigned to an agent, with description and expected output.

5. **Implemented the logic in `crew.py`:**
   You used the decorators `@agent`, `@task`, and `@crew`.
   The crew ran in sequential order using `Process.sequential`.

6. **Ran the project:**

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

   The debate completed successfully, including a decision by the judge.

### What can you do next?

**Optional extension to practice:**

Split the `debater` into two agents, like this in `agents.yaml`:

```yaml
proposer:
  llm: openai/gpt-4o-mini

opposer:
  llm: deepseek-ai/deepseek-chat
```

Then update `tasks.yaml`:

```yaml
propose:
  agent: proposer
oppose:
  agent: opposer
```

This allows you to:

* Compare different LLMs (e.g., OpenAI vs DeepSeek, vs Claude)
* Alternate roles and measure consistency and persuasion
* Use a neutral judge and build your own leaderboard of model performance

**What does this teach you?**

* How to fully structure and run a CrewAI project from scratch
* How to plug in and test multiple models
* How to automate debates and measure persuasiveness

**Suggested next step**

You can build a notebook (e.g., `debate_leaderboard.ipynb`) that tests different combinations of models in debate roles and logs which model wins more often according to a judge.

Would you like a ready-made CrewAI project template that includes:

* two agents (`proposer` and `opposer`)
* a judge
* predefined model options
* auto-logging of decisions

Let me know the format you want: `.zip`, `.py`, `.yaml`, or `.ipynb`.

## Building Crew AI Projects: Tools, Context & Google Search Integration

To quickly recap what we did last time, we learned about an **agent**, the agent being the smallest autonomous unit. It has an LLM associated with it (although it doesn't actually need to — you can have an agent without an LLM, but they typically do). It has a **role**, a **goal**, a **backstory**, and it also has **memory** and **tools**, not that we've looked at either of them just yet.

And then a **task** — this is the concept which doesn't have an analogue in OpenAI Agent SDK. A task is an **assignment to be carried out** with a **description**, **expected output**, perhaps an **output file**, and it's **assigned to an agent**.

And then a **crew**, which is a **team of agents and tasks** together, assigned to those agents, and they can run **sequentially or hierarchically**, in which case you'd have to assign a manager LLM to figure out which task is assigned to which agent.

</p>


So that's the overall structure of Crew, which now should be pretty familiar to you.
And you'll remember that there are **five steps** that we went through when we set up our first crew project:

1. We created a project:

   ```bash
   crewai create crew my_project
   ```

2. We went into `source/my_project/config` and edited the YAML files for **agents** and **tasks**.

3. We edited `crew.py` to define the **agents**, **tasks**, and the **crew**, referencing the YAML config.

4. We updated `main.py` to define inputs — in our case, the **motion** for the debate.

5. We ran the crew with:

   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```

## Introducing the Second Project: Financial Researcher

Now we’re going to go a little bit deeper in two ways in our next project:

1. **Tools** – equipping agents with capabilities (something you're probably familiar with from other frameworks).
2. **Context** – passing information from one task to the next, CrewAI-style.

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/18.png" width="500"/>
</p>

But first, let’s sign up for a powerful new tool that will allow our agents to access the web.

We’ll use **[Serper.dev](https://serper.dev)** — a lightning-fast and free API for Google search.

* Visit: [https://serper.dev](https://serper.dev)
* Sign up for an account (you’ll receive 2,500 free credits)
* Copy your API Key and paste it into your `.env` file as:

```env
SERPER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

> ⚠️ Don’t confuse **Serper.dev** with **SerpAPI** – they are different services!


Now let’s create our new project called `financial_researcher`:

**Defining our agents**. 

This block defines the researcher agent. Its role is to act as a Senior Financial Researcher for the given company. The agent’s goal is to research the company, find news, and assess its potential. The backstory describes the agent as someone skilled at identifying and presenting the most relevant information. The model assigned here is OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.

```yml

This block defines the analyst agent. Its job is to analyze the target company and write a comprehensive report. The backstory highlights the analyst’s meticulous approach and skill in turning research into valuable, clear insights. This agent also uses GPT-4o-mini.

```yml
analyst:
  role: >
    Market Analyst and Report writer focused on {company}
  goal: >
    Analyze company {company} and create a comprehensive, well-structured report
    that presents insights in a clear and engaging way
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous, skilled analyst with a background in financial analysis
    and company research. You have a talent for identifying patterns and extracting
    meaningful insights from research data, then communicating
    those insights through well crafted reports.

```

**Tasks Configuration**

The research task, assigned to the researcher, details what to investigate about the company (current status, history, challenges, opportunities, news, outlook). Findings should be well organized into clear sections.


```yml
# src/research_crew/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct thorough research on company {company}. Focus on:
    1. Current company status and health
    2. Historical company performance
    3. Major challenges and opportunities
    4. Recent news and events
    5. Future outlook and potential developments

    Make sure to organize your findings in a structured format with clear sections.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive research document with well-organized sections covering
    all the requested aspects of {company}. Include specific facts, figures,
    and examples where relevant.
  agent: researcher
```

The analysis task, assigned to the analyst, requires a report based on the research findings, including an executive summary, key information, insights, and a market outlook. The report must be professional and easy to read.
Importantly, the analysis task takes the research_task as its context, ensuring output continuity, and the result is saved to output/report.md.

```yml
analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the research findings and create a comprehensive report on {company}.
    Your report should:
    1. Begin with an executive summary
    2. Include all key information from the research
    3. Provide insightful analysis of trends and patterns
    4. Offer a market outlook for company, noting that this should not be used for trading decisions
    5. Be formatted in a professional, easy-to-read style with clear headings
  expected_output: >
    A polished, professional report on {company} that presents the research
    findings with added analysis and insights. The report should be well-structured
    with an executive summary, main sections, and conclusion.
  agent: analyst
  context:
    - research_task
  output_file: output/report.md
```

**Research `Crew.py` Implementation**

This file defines the `ResearchCrew class`, which wires up our agents and tasks.
* There are two agents: researcher and analyst.
* Two tasks: research_task and analysis_task.
* The crew runs the agents and tasks in a sequential process, meaning each task waits for the previous to finish, ensuring correct order and context passing.

```py
# src/financial_researcher/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

@CrewBase
class ResearchCrew():
    """Research crew for comprehensive topic analysis and reporting"""

    @agent
    def researcher(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
            verbose=True,
            tools=[SerperDevTool()]
        )

    @agent
    def analyst(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['analyst'],
            verbose=True
        )

    @task
    def research_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['research_task']
        )

    @task
    def analysis_task(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['analysis_task'],
            output_file='output/report.md'
        )

    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        """Creates the research crew"""
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,
            tasks=self.tasks,
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True,
        )
```

**`main.py` Script to Run the Crew**
* It ensures the output directory exists.
* Sets the company to be researched.
* Instantiates the ResearchCrew and kicks it off with the company input.
* Prints the result and confirms where the report was saved.


```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/financial_researcher/main.py
import os
from financial_researcher.crew import ResearchCrew

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('output', exist_ok=True)

def run():
    """
    Run the research crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'company': 'Apple'
    }

    # Create and run the crew
    result = ResearchCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)

    # Print the result
    print("\n\n=== FINAL REPORT ===\n\n")
    print(result.raw)

    print("\n\nReport has been saved to output/report.md")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

To run the workflow, open a terminal in the project folder and execute the command to start the process (e.g., crewai run). Inputs like the company name will be assigned automatically, and you’ll see the research agent take on the assigned task. Some models may be slower but provide more detailed research.

The process is set to sequential, and all verbose output is enabled for transparency.
