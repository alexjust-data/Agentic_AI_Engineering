    "\n",
    "We know this use case very well, since many Frontier Labs already offer this kind of agent through their online chat tools. For example, on OpenAI, you can go to GPT and press the Deep Research button — this runs the model in deep research mode, which is essentially executing an agentic workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we’re going to do just that. We’re going to give our agents the ability to do deep research, and we’ll make use of a few concepts we’ve already learned. We’re going to use tools, of course. We’re going to use structured outputs again — we touched on those briefly last time, and we’ll go a bit deeper this time. And for the first time, we’re going to use hosted tools, which are tools running remotely."

       "**LangChain** is a prominent open-source framework that enables developers to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Its modular design allows for seamless integration of various components, facilitating the creation of complex workflows by chaining together different models and data sources. This flexibility makes LangChain suitable for a wide range of applications, including conversational agents, document analysis, and code generation.

       "**LangGraph**, an extension of LangChain, introduces a graph-based approach to managing agent workflows. This framework is particularly useful for applications requiring complex decision-making processes, such as loan processing or insurance claims. LangGraph allows developers to define agent steps and logic as nodes and edges in a graph, providing explicit control over information flow and enabling branching and debugging of complex agent behaviors.

    "The workflow finished successfully. My three searches were completed, the process ended with “hooray,” and I received a nicely formatted HTML email. The email included a strong introduction, an overview, and detailed analysis, with references and links at the bottom that actually work. I was impressed by how professional the result looked, especially considering how little code was needed to build this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the initial results were somewhat simple, I realized how easy it is to expand the workflow. By increasing the number of searches to 20, I generated a much more substantial report. This new version included not only the main frameworks, but also extra information—such as specific applications, benefits, commercial implications, and a longer, richer conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could see in the trace that all the agents (planner, search, writer, and email) ran exactly as expected. The search tasks ran in parallel thanks to AsyncIO, while the report writing and emailing were done sequentially. This clear trace showed me exactly how each step of the process unfolded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I’m very satisfied with how simple, flexible, and powerful this framework is. I can see many ways to expand or adapt it for deeper or broader research, and I’d recommend experimenting with the setup to see what else it can do. Building an automated, agent-based research tool is surprisingly straightforward and effective with this approach."
