If you look at each of these SalesAgent tools, representing by this sort of green thing, you'll see that underneath that was an agent. So this hopefully makes it crystal clear for you that we had an agent, the professional sales agent that was wrapped in the tool SalesAgent1. And you can see that again for this one and for this one, but in the case of SendEmail, it was simply a function that was called with a body. But you can look through the trace, and you should look through the trace, and understand the interactions between tools and agents to allow the sales manager to carry out its full activity, allowing itself to make its decisions about what it does in what order.\n"

And then, this was the handoff you can see here, shown. Then it goes to the email manager, and then that goes to the subject writer, followed by the converter, followed by the send email. And you'll see the control does not then come back. So you're seeing everything in action here. The sales manager that's able to handle things, and it hands off here. And the email manager takes the rest of control for the rest of this blue timeline that you see highlighted in here. You can see the multiple calls to different agents and the handoff and the use of tools, both wrapping agents and just directly calling functions.
