    "### Asynchronous LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so I also am going to introduce this time asynchronous LandGraph, using LandGraph in async mode, which I promised was going to happen this week. And it's very similar to using LandGraph in sync mode. When we used to call tool.run to run a tool, you can now call await tool.arun to run the tool asynchronously by passing the same inputs, otherwise it's just the same. And to invoke the graph, if we would have said graph.invokeState before, we can now say await graph.ainvokeState. So that is just simply a way to run LandGraph in asynchronous mode, and that is what we're going to be doing. \n",

You just have one field I'm going to have called messages, it is annotated, the type is a list, and this is telling LandGraph we want it to use addMessages, which is a canned function that you can import. We want that to be the reducer, which is going to keep on adding messages whenever we return that ZOS state from a node. And we will start a graph builder with that state. "

    "### Next: Install Playwright\n",
    "\n",
    " PlayWrite. Do you know what PlayWrite is? PlayWrite is one of these browser automation bits of software. It's considered the next generation of Selenium, which many, many people have used. I've used Selenium an awful lot. PlayWrite is by Microsoft, and it's a very nice framework for running a browser. It's traditionally, originally used for testing, so it's used for test purposes. A lot of people also use it for web scraping, because if you just try and request a web page, you just get back the server content. If you use something like Selenium or PlayWrite, you can actually render it in a browser, run the JavaScript, paint the page, and then use that to actually get the content. So PlayWrite is a powerful tool for running a browser window, and it can do so what they call headless, which means you don't even see the browser window. It's just like running behind the scenes. Or not headless, headful, in which case you see the browser screen yourself and you can interact with it. So that is PlayWrite. You may already know it. A lot of people use PlayWrite. This is how you install it. You type PlayWrite install to do it on Windows and Mac OS or Linux. It's this longer command, and it will then be installed. And if you have problems with that, then let me know, but hopefully not. \n",

    "### Introducing nest_asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "Python async code only allows for one \"event loop\" processing aynchronous events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nest_asyncio` library patches this, and is used for special situations, if you need to run a nested event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, one other thing to mention, one other little detail here, and this is just for running it in a notebook. One of the problems, one of the challenges with AsyncIO is that AsyncIO runs an event loop. And when it runs an event loop, it runs this thing that's just constantly making sure that it's running anything that's being awaited. And then when it's holding on IO, it runs something else that's being awaited. And one of the problems is that AsyncIO only supports one event loop, and if there's an event loop running, you can't, within that event loop, run another event loop. And we're running an event loop as part of running this notebook right now. And so that can cause problems when you try and kick off Async processors within Async processors. And so there is this package called NestAsyncIO that's quite popular, which you can just simply use this, and then it patches AsyncIO so that you can have an event loop within an event loop. And as you will soon understand from me prattling away, we're going to want that because we're going to want to run PlayWrite asynchronously. Because we're going to build an agent that can drive PlayWrite. And so we're going to need that concept of an event loop within an event loop. But when we later put this into Python code, we actually won't need this anymore, but we'll need it for now. "

    "So one of the incredible things about LandGraph and LandChain, I'm becoming a convert of both, is that they come with so many great tools out of the box. Many of them are in the community package. There's actually a couple of different ways that you can run PlayWrite. There's two sets of tools. One of them is a more simplistic one that's just a bit higher level. This one that I've got here, the PlayWrite Browser Toolkit, this is a lower level set of tools which provides a bunch of different tools. We're going to create this. So this is creating an asynchronous PlayWrite browser. And then it's building a toolkit from that browser. And now we've got the tools into a variable tool. \n",
