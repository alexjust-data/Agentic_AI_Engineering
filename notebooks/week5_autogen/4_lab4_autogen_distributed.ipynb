    "and now I mentioned that the distributed runtime consists of these two things. One of them is the host, and this is how you create the host, autogen-x-runtimes-grpc, the grpc-worker-agent-runtime-host. So this is something which uses grpc, the remote procedure technique, to be able to send messages, and this host will run on my local host on port 50051, and I will start it with this. So this is now going to be a running host, and grpc, of course, is a cross-language approach for sending function calls between different languages, and it's super powerful. It's used in many different places you can think of it. It's like making REST HTTP calls, except you're able to call directly from one function to another, and grpc is used all over the place where interactive messaging needs to be implemented that crosses process boundaries. So that is grpc. We've started a host, and it is running, "

We're trying to make a business decision, and let's say that business decision is whether we should use autogen in a new AI agent project, and we want to have two different agents. One agent research the pros of autogen by using web searches, and the other agent research the cons, the negatives, the drawbacks. And so the two agents will go off and do their analysis, do their searching, and then they will come together, and we will have a judge agent that must make a decision whether to use autogen for a project, and it must be based purely on research from its team, from its agent team respond with the decision brief rationale.

So we are going to of course have the same message, the same host that we start running on localize to 5.0.5.1, and we use the same tools, the same instructions, we make the same agents, our agent code isn't touched, but now it's going to be managed differently.\n",

    "We're now going to run this and we're going to be following this line right here, and this is actually going to create three different runtimes that I'm calling worker one, worker two, and worker, and it's worker for the third one, the judge's one. And we're going to start each of these three glpc worker runtimes, and then player one, we're going to register with worker one, player two with worker two, and the judge with just the one that's just called worker. And so that is happening.\n",
    "\n",

    "worker1 = GrpcWorkerAgentRuntime(host_address=\"localhost:50051\")\n",

    "**3. Conceptual Difference Between Modes**\n",
    "\n",
    "And so what's the difference here? What we're saying is that instead of having our three agents running in a remote worker on our remote host, we now have three workers, and the three workers each running one of our agents. So they're now in different runtimes. They're all on the same host, but you could imagine that this is now, they're completely separate.

    "And so now we send the same go message, and presumably very similar messages, and now crossing the ether, one agent is calling gpc4rmini for the pros, one agent for the cons, and then as a result of that, they will come back to the judge, and the judge has come. We see pretty similar looking pros, the community and support is a new one, I think. Scalability is up at first. The cons, limited customization, that seems to slightly fly in the face of flexibility. I guess our agents disagree. Performance variability, cost considerations, and ethical content control, okay. But nonetheless, the recommendation is to proceed. That is the view of even when we distribute across multiple workers, it does still maintain that viewpoint. So there we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = await worker.send_message(Message(content=\"Go!\"), agent_id)\n",
    "display(Markdown(response.content))\n",

    "**5. Conclusion and Architectural Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the example I wanted to show you. I know we've gone through it quickly, but it's just to get that sense that the powerful thing about this is that without changing your code with the same definitions of your classes, these can be running in different configurations and different kinds of runtimes, and basically what Autogen is doing is it's handling message calling across process boundaries as transparently as if these were just simply classes with methods calling each other directly in Python code. That abstraction is what it's doing, and when you think about a future where potentially there could be millions or maybe even billions of agents interacting all over the place, what Microsoft is doing is putting their stake in the ground for this is a sort of playpen. This is a world where agents can live and interact. You just put your agent code within this wrapper, this agent wrapper. You make your versions of message so that you declare the way that we have, and then your agents can interact with each other no matter where they are in the world and no matter what programming language they're written in.\n",

       "Here are several reasons in favor of choosing AutoGen for your new AI Agent project:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Customizability**: AutoGen allows developers to create content tailored to specific needs, which enhances flexibility in adapting agents for various tasks.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Multi-Agent Cooperation**: The framework supports multiple agents that can communicate and collaborate, fostering divergent thinking and more robust problem-solving methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Time Efficiency**: AutoGen enhances productivity by enabling agents to complete tasks quickly and efficiently, saving significant time in workflow management.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Continuous Improvement**: Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen benefits from regular updates and enhancements, ensuring access to the latest features and improvements.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Modular Design**: The framework is modular and easy to maintain, suitable for both straightforward and complex multi-agent scenarios, which simplifies development and scaling.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Enhanced Reasoning and Factuality**: Using AutoGen can improve the reasoning abilities and factual accuracy of AI agents, leading to better performance in decision-making tasks.\n",

       "## Cons of AutoGen:\n",
       "Here are some key cons of using AutoGen in your AI Agent project:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Poor Documentation**: Many users find the documentation difficult to read and lacking in sufficient examples, making it challenging to properly implement the framework.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Functionality Issues**: There are reports of certain features, such as structured outputs, not functioning as intended, which could hinder development.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Lack of Differentiation**: AutoGen has not clearly differentiated itself from similar applications, which may lead to confusion about its unique benefits and features.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Potential Bugs**: Users have experienced instances where some aspects of the software do not work as promised, raising concerns about reliability.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Steep Learning Curve**: Due to the documentation quality and complexity, developers may face a steep learning curve when trying to adopt AutoGen.\n",

       "Based on the research provided by the team, I recommend using AutoGen for the project. The pros, particularly the customizability, multi-agent cooperation, and time efficiency, outweigh the cons related to documentation and potential functionality issues. The capability for enhanced reasoning and continuous improvement from Microsoft is particularly advantageous for developing effective AI agents. While the steep learning curve and poor documentation are valid concerns, the overall benefits of versatility and performance enhancement make AutoGen a strong candidate for the project's needs.\n",
