    "And we're right back in Cursor again, of course, and we're going into the Week 6 folder. And we're going to Lab 2 to create our own MCP server and client, which, as I quote here, it's pretty simple, but it's not super simple. The reason people are excited about MCP is that it's so simple to use other tools, not necessarily to create MCP servers. The first thing we're going to do, though, is we're going to look at a Python module. And I know that many people would much rather spend more time with Python modules than in labs. And this week, we'll be doing both. We'll be starting in labs. We will be moving to just Python code in modules. And there is a Python module called accounts.py. \n",

And you can tell it's because of comments and type hints. And you probably know that I'm a bit hacky with this stuff, and that I only write comments and type hints when I'm forced. But here, our agent crew did a wonderful job. So it's cool that we're taking the code here that is being used by our agents.\n",

    "Now it's MCP server time. So writing an MCP server is pretty easy. It's just boilerplate code that you use to wrap code you've already got into an MCP server, and you use some libraries provided by Anthropic. And let's have a look. I've created one, a Python module called accountserver.py. Let's see what happens. So it begins by importing an Anthropic class called FastMCP, and we also import our business logic, account.

When I first started working on this lab, the way that you work with OpenAI Agents SDK, they didn't sort of natively support MCP. You had to write your own client and then provide the tools into OpenAI Agents SDK. And it was the day that I finished this project and checked it into GitHub and did the push, that same day, about two or three hours later, they released an update to OpenAI Agents SDK that simplified everything. All my code was useless. You can look at the Git timestamps if you don't believe me. It was crazy. I was infuriated. But it is a great thing and basically means that just with this context manager construct, you automatically get OpenAI Agents SDK creating the client for you.\n",

    "And just to show you, I could also, of course, just import the business logic directly, and this is ending up just calling this function report. So this should give exactly the same answer. You can see the same stuff. So essentially, what we've done is we've taken this piece of business logic. We've wrapped it in an MCP server to be available as a certain resource. We've written an MCP client that allows you to expose that resource, and that is what this function is. And so you can call this MCP client to get this. You could also just call the business logic directly. And so why would you want to do this? Again, it's if you wanted to share this resource with other people. It gives everyone a simple, streamlined way to access your resources rather than having to understand how your business logic works. Okay."

    "Okay, that wraps up creating MCP servers and MCP clients, with most of the emphasis on the servers. And I would now like to give you an exercise to go and create your own. So one super simple one to do would be to write an MCP server that can tell you the current date, give the current date, and you can expose it as a tool that you can equip OpenAI agent with so that it can find out the current date and it can make sure that what is the content of the question it's answering, it's doing so mindful of what the current date is. And, yeah, then as a part of that exercise, you could not only build that MCP server, but also build an MCP client to accompany it, taking a look at exactly how I just did that for the accounts client, compared with the accounts server, same approach. And then you could actually write something that makes like a native call to OpenAI, as we did in week one, like a simple native call with a tool as a JSON, and then you're getting really bare metal, and you're seeing how you can call an NLM and have an MCP client and an MCP server where you're writing all the nuts and bolts. The only real use of that is to give you some direct exposure to it, so only do that if you're interested. You won't have to do that day to day, but it's an interesting exercise. It's also worth pointing out that actually answering the current date isn't a great tool, isn't super useful in the real world, because if you need to tell your agent about the current date, it's better just to state it in the prompt so that it always has it available, so that the model doesn't have to go through the extra work of knowing to call your tool to collect the date. So, if you feel like it, try to make some more interesting tools. Have a shot at making a calculator that can do some calculation operation on two inputs, or something like that. So try and make some interesting tool that appeals to you, and then write an MCP server, and perhaps also explore the MCP client, should you wish. Enjoy that, and we will then go over to wrap up for today."
