    "So, the first type of MCP server that I mentioned is one that you run locally, and everything it does is local. Again, remembering, we downloaded it from a public repo, somewhere public, but we're going to run it. Server will be applied locally. And we're going to pick another JavaScript one, a node one, and I want to pick this one, which is great. It is a way to give our agent memory, and to give it knowledge graph-based memory, a special kind of memory that understands about entities and observations about those entities and relationships between those entities. Memory is a hot topic, and people often ask me questions about memory, and they think of memory like it's kind of one construct, perhaps because LangChain thinks of it that way, but like there is one memory. But in this MCP age, we think of memory just as being another set of tools that we can equip our LLM with. And in fact, it could have many different types of tools relating to memory. This in particular is giving it the ability to store information about things, observations, and relationships. We could give it this, and we could give it other kinds of context. All of this ends up just being information that it can request by tools or that becomes available in its prompts. And so they're just different techniques to give the LLM more context. Anyway, so these are the parameters. Remember, you will start by specifying the parameters of your MCP server. And in this case, it's MPX because we're running a node version, and we're going to be running this version called libsql, which is a version, a memory that stores to a SQL-like database. I've actually given a link here to one that this is closely based on, which is one that gives you access to a JSON file, but doesn't actually store it to SQL. And I found that this is a little bit less stable. This is a better version of it that I prefer. It also allows you to specify a directory and a name for your memory. And this allows you to have different memory stores for different agents. So I find that quite handy. So I'm saying that look in somewhere called memory and look for a database called ed. And I believe it might already exist. It does. So why don't we just delete this so that it doesn't have any memory to start with? And move that to trash, starting from nothing. So if you have ed in a folder there, then delete it. If you don't have a folder, then create one called memory.\n"

And so this is just a great starting example, and we'll be using this memory in the future as well, and it could be handy for any of your projects too.

Okay.
