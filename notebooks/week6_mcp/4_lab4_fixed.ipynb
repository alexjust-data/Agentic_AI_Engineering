We saw that in the traces that it bought Tesla stock, and it didn't report that it bought Tesla stock, and we didn't see that in our holdings at the end. So let's go back and see what happened there. So I went back into the trace, and I took a look, and I scrolled down a load more, and sure enough, if we get down to the bottom here, you will see that there were indeed these two buying the shares. First of all, it bought 50 Disney shares, and then, as I remember, it bought 30 Tesla shares. What's going on? Well, then I scrolled down and saw that it got an error back from this. Error executed tool, insufficient funds to buy shares. And what's kind of brilliant about this is that that error message is an error message that was written by our crew agents in week three. We asked it one of our business requirements, is that it should put something in there that prevents the person from buying more shares than they can afford. And so that error message, insufficient funds to buy shares, was written by those crew agents. That's what's been surfaced back here, and that is why those shares weren't bought, and that's why it didn't include that on its summary, and, indeed, why, although it does mention that it should be monitored in the next steps, and that's why, of course, it isn't in the holdings at the bottom. So there's a great explanation, and everything is working perfectly."
