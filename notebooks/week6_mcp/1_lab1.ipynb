    "Remember, with these labs, the first thing you need to do is click up here to set the kernel, something which you know back to front by now. So, welcome to the Model Context Protocol. Welcome back, OpenAI Agents SDK, which I may have mentioned just happens to be my favorite. Please do note that as I go through this and you see the code here, it might look different to you as you go through it in the lab. And that’s a good thing. That’s because I’m constantly updating this. MCP is very much a moving target. It is, honestly, evolving so quickly. There’s new stuff all the time. I try and keep the labs as updated as possible. If you haven’t done this before, then be sure to pull the latest code. There are instructions in the guides, if you’re new to this, on how to use Git and run Git Pull.

    "Now, I need to start with some bad news. Some news for Windows PC people. There is a production problem with MCP that means MCP may not work out of the box with Windows PCs. There are some workarounds, but they are hokey and they're not reliable. And there is only one real proper solution to this, and it’s a bit of a bore. You will need to install something called WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux. That allows you to run a Linux operating system on your PC and be running Cursor connected to that. If you do that, MCP will work fabulously. Thanks to many students who helped me diagnose this and helped me discover that it really is a true, genuine issue, we now know there is no way around it, or at least no reliable way around it, and that the proper solution is using WSL. That is now well confirmed.\n",

The stuff that you want to work on should be in your Linux home directory. When you first launch WSL, there are two ways to do it. You can type `wsl`, or you can type `ubuntu`. It’s important to know that if you type `ubuntu`, you go straight into your Linux home directory. So that’s the safer way to do it. Otherwise, just make sure that you change to your Linux home directory. The instructions are in the setup guide.\n",

    "**Introduction to MCP in OpenAI Agents SDK**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to use MCP in the OpenAI Agents SDK. The approach will be to create an MCP client, have it start a server, and then retrieve the list of tools that this server can use. We will start with **Fetch**, the MCP server we examined earlier. This server runs a headless browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with MCP servers, everything starts with **parameters**. Parameters define the MCP server and are written as a dictionary containing specific configuration values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters describe what command should be run on the command line to spawn the MCP server, as well as any arguments it requires. In our example, the command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fetch_params = {\"command\": \"uvx\", \"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `uvx` is essentially the same as running `uv run`, which installs and runs a Python package or script. Many MCP servers follow this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `uvx` specifies the execution method.\n",
    "2. The next argument is the name of the repository or package to install locally.\n",
    "3. Finally, it runs that installed package as a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating the MCP Client and Server**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the parameters are defined, we can instruct OpenAI Agents SDK to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an MCP client.\n",
    "2. Spawn the MCP server as described in the parameters.\n",
    "3. Ask the server for a list of tools it can provide to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is made very simple by OpenAI Agents SDK. Using a context manager with `MCPServerStdio` (a standard input/output type MCP server), we pass in the parameters and optionally specify a longer timeout than the default 5 seconds, which can be unreliable. A timeout of 30 or 60 seconds is often better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async with MCPServerStdio(params=fetch_params, client_session_timeout_seconds=60) as server:\n",
    "    fetch_tools = await server.list_tools()\n",
    "\n",
    "fetch_tools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Happens Behind the Scenes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The SDK runs the given command (`uvx mcp-server-fetch`) locally to start a new Python process, which becomes the MCP server.\n",
    "2. The MCP client, running inside the OpenAI Agents SDK, connects to this server.\n",
    "3. The client requests the list of available tools from the server.\n",
    "4. The result is returned and can be printed or used directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire process can complete in under a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the server returned a tool named **Fetch** with the description:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fetches a URL from the internet and optionally extracts its contents as markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the tool description also contains an important note:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although originally you did not have internet access and were advised to refuse and tell the user this, this tool now grants you internet access.\n",
    "\n",
    "This detail is crucial because many LLMs were trained with the assumption that they do not have internet access. By including this clarification, the tool developers (Anthropic) ensure that the LLM understands that it *can* now perform online searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "If this explicit note were not in the tool description, the LLM might continue to refuse online search requests due to prior training. Including such context is a form of prompt engineering built directly into the tool metadata. By using the Fetch MCP server, this functionality and its correct usage are automatically communicated to the LLM—no extra work is required by the developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes our first look at creating an MCP client, connecting it to an MCP server, and retrieving the available tools.\n"

    "**Using the Browser and File Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser navigate tool is used to navigate the webpage. Yours may look different, and you may see more actions there. After that, the file tool is used. For some reason, it performed a refile, and then it executed the write file action to save the banoffee pie recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the interaction between the tools. You should examine it and check that it behaves as you expect. Verify that it is using the right tools in the correct way.\n",

    "**The Aha Moment: MCP Marketplaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "The “aha” moment — when you realize what makes MCP so exciting — often comes when you first see an MCP marketplace. Marketplaces are websites where you can explore all the MCP servers available for equipping your agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular and common example is **mcp.so**. Opening the mcp.so marketplace reveals a list of featured MCP servers, including the Playwright MCP server we just used. By selecting it, you can view the parameters used for integration and see the tools it can provide. Notably, this one was created by Microsoft, which suggests it is likely legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By pressing the **Explore** tab in the main navigation, you can search and filter through categories. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4,000 in Research and Data\n",
    "* 68 in Browser Automation\n",
    "* 34 in Knowledge and Memory (for equipping your agent with different ways to remember information)\n",
    "* 19 Calendar Managers\n",
    "* Many in Monitoring and Visualization\n",
    "* **Developer Tools** — the largest category — with 7,344 entries\n",
    "\n",
    "There is likely overlap between categories, but the numbers give a sense of the vast range of MCP servers you can explore for your agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring Other Marketplaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular MCP server marketplace is **Glamour**. Clicking on the “Every MCP Server” link shows all available servers. Glamour includes ratings for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Security\n",
    "* Licensing permissiveness\n",
    "* Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "They also explain how these ratings are determined, which is useful for assessing security. Again, the number of MCP servers available is considerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Security is a significant topic in the MCP community. Running an MCP server means running code on your computer, often someone else’s code. While there is also discussion around authentication for remote or hosted MCP servers, in most cases you are running them locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this might seem risky — and it is — but it is essentially no different from performing a `pip install` or `npm install` of open-source code. You are always assuming some information risk when using community-developed tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, due diligence is essential:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If it is from a trusted publisher (e.g., Microsoft, Anthropic), it is probably safe.\n",
    "* Otherwise, check the GitHub repository for stars, an active community, and good feedback.\n",
    "* Review any available security reports or code directly to ensure you are comfortable running it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some MCP servers can run inside Docker containers, offering additional security controls. Still, you should research the publisher and repository before deciding to run the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risk for Non-Technical Users**\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concern is that non-technical users — for example, those adding MCP servers to Cloud Desktop — may not have the skills to assess security. They might not check the GitHub repository, community activity, or publisher credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "For developers and experienced users, these skills allow for proper vetting of open-source packages before installation. The security risk is higher when end users skip this due diligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Marketplace Ratings as a Filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the Llama marketplace, you can view the security ratings assigned to MCP servers and read about the tests conducted to earn those ratings. For example, you might choose only to use MCP servers that receive triple-A ratings on Llama as your starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring MCP Marketplaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several MCP marketplaces available, each offering a wide range of servers to explore and integrate. One popular option is **MCP.so** ([https://mcp.so](https://mcp.so)), which features many well-known MCP servers. A specific example within this marketplace is the **Playwright MCP server** by Microsoft ([https://mcp.so/server/playwright-mcp/microsoft?tab=tools](https://mcp.so/server/playwright-mcp/microsoft?tab=tools)), where you can review its tools, usage parameters, and even run it directly from the command line using MPX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another prominent marketplace is **Glama** ([https://glama.ai/mcp](https://glama.ai/mcp)). It provides ratings for security, licensing, and quality, which can be helpful when assessing MCP servers before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Smithery** marketplace ([https://smithery.ai/](https://smithery.ai/)) is also widely used. Here you will likely recognize many familiar MCP servers. Most popular MCP servers appear across multiple marketplaces, but Smithery offers a convenient way to explore them. For example, Playwright by Microsoft is also listed here, and you can see how to run it from the command line, check the available tools, and obtain parameters once logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Resources and Articles**\n",
    "\n",
    "A valuable community article can be found on Hugging Face ([https://huggingface.co/blog/LLMhacker/top-11-essential-mcp-libraries](https://huggingface.co/blog/LLMhacker/top-11-essential-mcp-libraries)) listing essential MCP libraries, including well-known marketplaces such as MCP.so and Smithery. Another Hugging Face post ([https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp](https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/mcp)) provides a thoughtful perspective on the MCP ecosystem—highlighting what makes MCP genuinely exciting, clarifying misconceptions, and distinguishing reality from hype.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other useful sources. Cursor has its own directory to integrate MCP servers directly into its environment, enabling agents to gain new capabilities seamlessly. The official MCP open-source project hosted by Anthropic includes robust reference servers such as **Fetch** and **Climb**, which can serve as excellent starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why MCP Servers Are Exciting**\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP servers can run in different ways, but the two main transport mechanisms are **Studio** and **SSE**. The real appeal lies in the simplicity and low friction of connecting your agent to a wide variety of tools built by contributors worldwide. With thousands of MCP servers available, there is a vast pool of capabilities to draw from.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Looking Ahead**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next time, we will take the step of building our own MCP server and client so we can contribute to this growing ecosystem ourselves. This will help deepen our understanding of MCP hosts, clients, and servers, and how they fit into the broader landscape of agent tool integration.\n",
