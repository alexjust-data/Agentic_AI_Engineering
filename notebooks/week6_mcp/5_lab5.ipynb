We're going to give the traders autonomy to evolve their strategy. We're going to expand the number of models. You've already seen a little teaser of this, and we're going to build a user interface, which is going to have a surprise extra component, which is a super important piece of functionality extensibility that we can get through OpenAI Agents SDK.

    "And here we are once more in Cursor for the last time. We go into the sixth folder and we go to Lab 5, which is really more of a text thing, but let's just talk about what we have here. So actually now we've already taken a look at all of the MCP servers that we're going to be playing with, but it includes, of course, things like the push notification and the memory and everything else. But I want to be adding more in time, and I would like you to as well. And so if you go in there and you look in the MCP servers, you might find that there are more there already because I do plan to be adding more, and if not, you should keep adding them in. As of the time I record this, there are currently, as we just saw, six MCP servers with 44 different tools and two resources, and I do hope to be adding to them in time. Okay, so now to introduce you to the four traders that we have set up in our trading floor. We have four traders that are now known. They are named Warren, George, Ray, and Cathy, and they are paying homage to four luminaries of the industry. Warren, to the legend that is Warren Buffett, George to George Soros, Ray for Ray Dalio, and Cathy, perhaps an odd one out for a more modern investor, for Cathy Wood of ARK Investments. And they each have investment strategies inspired by their namesakes, but also I've given them autonomy to be changing their strategy in time. So let's look at this.\n",

    "So first of all, we need to go to a Python module called reset.py, and this is where the strategies are laid out. There is a Warren strategy. You're Warren. You're named in homage to your role model, Warren Buffett, a value-oriented investor prioritizing long-term wealth creation. George is named for George Soros, an aggressive macro trader. Ray, of course, a systematic principles-based approach with macroeconomic insights. And Cathy, who pursues disruptive innovation, particularly crypto. But I focus on crypto ETFs because this is all meant to be about equity trading. So ETFs is what we do. And reset traders will reset these four people to have this strategy. Now I'm not going to run that reset method myself because I've already had this running for a couple of weeks. I don't want to delete all that history. I want you to see how these traders have done for the last couple of weeks because that's going to be fun. So I won't reset, but you, of course, should so that you have the right strategies if you're looking at this. So you should uncomment this line right here and run reset traders so that everything is ready to begin.\n",

One of the things you might have thought about OpenAI Agents SDK is that whilst it is quite lightweight and simple, which is nice, it perhaps doesn't have the same level of resiliency and plumbing that something like Landgraf has with its connectivity to LangSmith. The trace functionality in OpenAI, it's a little bit sort of cheap or cheerful. You have to log into your OpenAI screen and then see the tracing in there. Well it happens that they thought of that. They've made the tracing functionality in OpenAI Agents SDK very extensible. You can, in fact, connect it to LangSmith to be able to look at your data in LangSmith. You can also connect it to things like weights and biases, which I teach in my other course, which is super useful. And indeed, you can extend it yourself to record trace information however you would like so that you can programmatically handle that with your agent flow and take actions as a result of the tracing. And that is really cool and it's very easy to do.\n",

    "See `tracers.py` - I've written a custom tracer that records our Trader activity and stores it in the database, so we can surface the Traders' inner thoughts on our UI.\n",

    "And I've done it here in this traces module. So you essentially make a subclass of an OpenAI class called TracingProcessor. And in that subclass, you have to override four methods. OnTraceStart, OnTraceEnd, OnSpanStart, and OnSpanEnd. And you get passed in an object that describes what's going on and you can then choose to do what you want, record it in any way. And what gets passed in could be one of a number of different types of data and you can pluck out relevant information and decide what to do with it. And so what did I use this for? What do I decide to do with it? I've decided to have my own little logging mechanism. And so I write this to my own log with a name and a type and a message. And I actually store this in SQLite. I have this write log, just writes it to a database based on this person's name so that I can keep track of these logs. And that allows me to take some actions as a result of the tracing activity happening in my agent framework. What would I like to do with that? Well, I'd like to display it. I'd like to be able to see on the user interface what are our traders actually doing? What are they thinking? What's going on? And I'd like to be able to reflect what is effectively being recorded in OpenAI's traces on the user interface. And that is what we will be doing.\n",

Here, in a nutshell, is the UI for our traders. And I got to tell you, I love this. So the four columns here represent our four traders. This is the trader view object with the trader behind it. Warren, and in this case, Warren is controlled by GPT-41-mini. George is DeepSeek-V3. Ray is Gemini-25-flash. And Kathy is using, appropriately for a crypto investor, Grok-3-mini. And one thing that's kind of fun is to see that this has been running for a few weeks. And all four of my traders are profitable. They all started with $10,000. That is what happens when you call reset. And none of them have made a fortune, but they have all made a little bit of money. And the winner right now is Kathy. Kathy seems to be doing quite well with her portfolio. And it does look like three out of the four have Nvidia stock in their portfolios. And you can see here some fun-looking stuff that we're seeing the trace information about these traders. And of course, we're seeing this chart here that shows what's been going on with their portfolios. And I haven't actually run them for a few days, which is why there's been this sort of jump down of their performance. So this is pretty cool. This is the user interface that's looking at our traders. But if you're following, you'll realize that we're not actually seeing anything dynamic here. We're just seeing a snapshot of the data in the database that reflects our four traders. What we really want to see is what happens when they start trading, when we actually kick this off and run it.

    "First we take a look at some code, and then we go and run our trading floor. So I wanted to point out that there are a few settings in the .emd file that you can control. You need to put these in there to make sure that things work properly. Run every n minutes, just literally like that, equals 60. We'll make sure that it runs every 60 minutes. Actually, if you don't include it in your own file, it will default to 60 anyway. Run, and even when the market is closed, is how you can make sure that it doesn't start trading overnight, every hour. Now I currently have this true, because it is Sunday right now and I want it to be trading. And use many models. If it's false, it just uses GPT-4 or many. If it's true, it uses the models that we just saw in the user interface. So obviously I have it as true. Alright, and now I need to show you the class that brings it all together that is wonderfully simple and is a fitting conclusion to the other material that we've covered. \n",

    "So we create a collection of traders for each of these different traders. And then, here is the runEveryNMinutes function. This is the one that does everything. It all happens here. We start by adding this trace. This is where we register that we want OpenAI Agents SDK to record any traces using that log tracer that I created, that I showed you a moment ago. We then create our traders, as I've done here. And then there's a nice little while true thing here, so this will keep going forever. It will then call asyncIO.gather, which you remember means that all these async methods will happen at the same time, trader.run for each of our traders. So all four traders will be kicked off at the same time. And asyncIO will make sure that they all run as if it's multi-threaded, but of course what's going on is that any time one of them is locked on IO, is waiting for something to come back, another one will run. It will allow them all to run. And at the end of that, it will then sleep for the number of minutes that we specify. \n",

    "And this is now kicking off our agent process and running our various agents. So it's running four different traders and their researchers right away. You can see, I hope, that the information in these panels has started flying by. And this, of course, is our user interface tracking the traces that we've intercepted and written ourselves so that we can be managing the logs. It's being stored to a database and showing here visibly on the user interface. And it is terrific fun to watch this and see autonomy in action. You'll see the different colors representing things like calling different MCP servers, actually using tools. The red, when you see it, is when it's actually calling our account's business logic, our own homegrown MCP server. And that noise, I don't know if it comes through on this mic, but it just made a notification noise that one of our four traders, Warren or George or Ray or Kathy, just made a trading decision and I got alerted about it. And they will now be off and running. It typically takes them a few minutes. Thanks to the joys of async coding, they can run in parallel like this. They do their thinking. They will go through managing their portfolio. And down below you can see things like their current holdings and their recent transactions so you can keep stock on what they're doing. And, yeah, as I say, it's terrific, terrific fun to see this. Here we go. You can see here sold five AMD shares, Retrieving Account Details, and then sold three Qualcomm and four Nvidia shares. Warren, they do tend to love Nvidia. So I hope everyone, which must be something to do with the researcher, and some other share activity going on and some update there to the values of the portfolios. Oh, and another text message I just got. And another one which is trading going on, AMD trade apparently. And, yeah, as I say, this is super addictive. I absolutely love watching this. Obviously the learning point here is to really get this very visual, very real, tangible sense of what it's like to have multiple agents working, calling other agents and using a bunch of different MCP servers to achieve a commercial objective and being able to use this as a way of inspecting what's going on and understanding the LLM activity that's happening behind the scenes to allow for this trading activity. So, hopefully, when you run this yourself and get this sense, you'll find it highly educational and insightful as well as being quite a lot of fun.\n",
